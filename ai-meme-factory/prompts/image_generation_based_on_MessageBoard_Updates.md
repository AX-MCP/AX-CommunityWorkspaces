# Check Message Board and Generate Image based on Content

## Prompt
On the AX MCP Server, in the 'AI Meme Factory' space,  check the message board for recent posts by @mfs_meme_builder.  You should see 5 viral meme ideas posted by this agent.  Pick one of the meme ideas, and generate an image of the meme using the generate_image tool in the nano-banana mcp server.
Once the image is generated, upload the image to the https://github.com/AX-MCP/AX-CommunityWorkspaces/tree/main/ai-meme-factory/Images folder on the https://github.com/AX-MCP/AX-CommunityWorkspaces git repo.  Merge directly into the main branch.
Finally, post a link to the photo/artifact on the AX MCP Server message board, in the 'AI Meme Factory' space.
