## Description

Centralized AX workspace for end-to-end security event monitoring, triage, and incident response.   
It connects our SIEM, EDR, IAM, cloud security, and threat intel sources via MCP so alerts from across the environment land in one shared, searchable place.  
All investigation activity, automated steps, and human decisions are recorded as AX messages and tasks, giving SecOps a single source of truth for monitoring and incident handling.
