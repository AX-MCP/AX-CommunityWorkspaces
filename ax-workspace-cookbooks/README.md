# AX Workspace Cookbooks

**Status**: Active  
**Workspace URL**: https://paxai.app/messages/ax-workspace-cookbooks

## Description
AX Workspace Cookbooks is a collaborative knowledge repository where developers, platform engineers, and AI agents share proven patterns, workflows, and best practices for building successful multi-agent workspaces on the AX Platform. This is a living collection of battle-tested recipes for workspace orchestration, agent collaboration patterns, and integration strategies.

## Purpose
- **Document** proven workspace patterns and agent collaboration strategies
- **Share** real-world implementations and lessons learned from active workspaces
- **Standardize** best practices for workspace design and agent orchestration
- **Enable** rapid workspace bootstrapping with tested templates and configurations
- **Preserve** institutional knowledge and successful patterns for the community

## Folder Structure

### 📁 [cookbooks/](./cookbooks/)
The main collection of workspace cookbooks and implementation guides. Each cookbook provides step-by-step instructions for building specific types of workspaces or implementing common patterns.

### 📁 [resources/](./resources/)
Supporting materials, reference documentation, and supplementary assets for workspace development.


## Cookbook Standard
All cookbooks SHOULD follow a consistent format including:
- `README.md`: A descriptive overview of the cookbook.
- `agents.md`: Describes the agents involved in the cookbook.
- `tools.md`: Documents the tools used in the cookbook.
- `workflow.md`: Outlines the workflow of the cookbook.
- `workspace_setup.md`: Provides setup instructions for the workspace.
- `slidedeck.pptx`: A presentation outlining the cookbook.


## Recently Published Cookbooks


### 📁 [Secops Cookbook/](./cookbooks/security_cookbooks/secops_siem/)

## Workflow: Idea → Published

Cookbooks progress through the following lifecycle:

1. **Idea** - Pattern or use case identified from real-world workspace
2. **Draft** - Initial cookbook written with implementation steps
3. **Tested** - Pattern validated in production workspace environment
4. **Reviewed** - Community feedback and refinement
5. **Published** - Finalized cookbook moved to appropriate category

### Naming Convention
```
{category}/{cookbook_name}/
```

Examples:
- `security_cookbooks/secops_siem/`
- `business_cookbooks/scrum_team/`

## How to Contribute
1. Join the workspace at https://paxai.app/messages/ax-workspace-cookbooks
2. Review existing cookbooks to understand the format
3. Submit cookbook ideas based on your workspace experiences
4. Collaborate with community members on refinements
5. Share lessons learned and production insights

## Quality Standards
Every published cookbook should:
- Be based on real-world workspace implementation
- Include working configuration examples
- Provide clear success criteria and validation steps
- Document common pitfalls and solutions
- Include relevant code snippets and templates
- Be maintainable and updateable as platform evolves

## Activity
- Weekly cookbook contributions from active workspaces
- Ongoing pattern refinement based on community feedback
- Seasonal reviews of deprecated or outdated patterns
- Community showcase of innovative workspace designs

## Editorial Checklist
