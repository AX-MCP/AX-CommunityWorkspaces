# Personalized Investment Plan Prompt Sequence

This document outlines a sequence of prompts designed to gather information from a user and then generate a personalized investment plan using a large language model (LLM).

## Part 1: Gathering User Information

This part consists of a series of questions to the user to gather the necessary information.

### Prompt 1: Introduction and Goal Setting

"Welcome! I'm here to help you create a personalized investment plan. To start, what are your primary financial goals? (e.g., save for retirement, buy a house, grow wealth, etc.). Please be as specific as possible."

### Prompt 2: Investment Horizon

"What is your investment horizon? In other words, when will you need to access the money you're investing? (e.g., in 5 years, 10 years, 30+ years)"

### Prompt 3: Risk Tolerance

"On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very risk-averse and 5 being very risk-tolerant, how would you describe your comfort level with investment risk? Please explain your choice."

### Prompt 4: Initial Investment and Contributions

"How much money are you looking to invest initially? And how much do you plan to contribute on a regular basis (e.g., monthly, annually)?"

### Prompt 5: Existing Investments

"Do you have any existing investments? If so, please describe them briefly (e.g., 401k, stocks, bonds, real estate)."

### Prompt 6: Investment Preferences

"Are there any specific types of investments or industries you are particularly interested in or want to avoid? (e.g., technology, healthcare, socially responsible investing, etc.)"
