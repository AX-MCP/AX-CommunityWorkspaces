# AI Agent Prompts for Online Course Niche Analysis (v2)

This document outlines a sequence of prompts for an AI agent to analyze market trends and identify underserved niches for new online courses. This version expands on the original prompts with more detail and guidance for the AI.

## Prompt 1: Broad Market Trend Analysis 2.0

**Objective:** To get a high-level overview of current trends in the online education market, with a focus on identifying emerging and rapidly growing areas.

**Prompt:**
> "Analyze the online education market over the past 12-18 months to identify the top 5-7 trending subject areas. For each area, provide:
> - **A detailed description:** What specific topics and skills are covered?
> - **Target Audience Demographics:** Go beyond a simple description. Include age range, professional background, typical motivations (e.g., career change, upskilling, hobby), and online platforms they frequent.
> - **Growth Drivers:** What are the key technological, economic, or cultural factors fueling this trend? Provide evidence from sources like Google Trends, LinkedIn Learning data, Coursera's Global Skills Report, and Udemy's marketplace insights.
> - **Emerging Sub-fields:** Within each major trend, what are the new, up-and-coming sub-fields or specializations that are showing early signs of high growth?

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "Imagine you are a market research analyst for a major online learning platform. Your task is to produce a report on 'The State of Online Learning in 2025'. Identify and analyze the most significant growth sectors. I'm particularly interested in niche skills that are just beginning to gain traction."

## Prompt 2: Deep-Dive Competitor Analysis 2.0

**Objective:** To gain a comprehensive understanding of the competitive landscape in the identified trending areas.

**Prompt:**
> "For each of the top 5 trending subject areas, conduct a deep-dive competitor analysis. Identify the 5-7 most successful online courses or learning paths. For each competitor, create a detailed profile:
> - **Course/Platform Name and URL**
> - **Pricing Strategy:** Analyze their pricing model (one-time fee, subscription tiers, etc.) and any perceived value for money.
> - **Instructional Style and Format:** Describe the teaching method (e.g., video lectures, project-based, interactive simulations) and the production quality.
> - **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** What makes this course stand out? What is its core marketing message?
> - **In-depth Strength and Weakness Analysis:** Go beyond the obvious. What are the subtle strengths (e.g., strong community, excellent instructor support) and hidden weaknesses (e.g., outdated content, poor user experience on mobile)?
> - **Comprehensive Student Sentiment Analysis:** Use NLP to analyze a broad range of student reviews (from the platform, Reddit, Trustpilot, etc.). Identify common themes of praise and complaint. What features do students love? What do they consistently criticize?

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "Reverse-engineer the success of the top online courses in [Subject Area]. Deconstruct their content, marketing, and community engagement strategies. What are the common patterns of success, and where are the gaps in their offerings?"

## Prompt 3: Granular Niche Identification 2.0

**Objective:** To pinpoint highly specific, underserved niches with strong market potential.

**Prompt:**
> "Based on the comprehensive market and competitor analysis, identify and evaluate potential underserved niches within each trending area. For each potential niche, create a 'Niche Opportunity Scorecard':
> - **Niche Definition:** A very specific description of the niche (e.g., 'Python for Scientific Computing on AWS' instead of 'Python for Data Science').
> - **Audience Demand Validation:** Provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of demand. Use keyword search volume data (from tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush), analyze questions on Stack Overflow and Reddit, and track conversations on relevant social media hashtags.
> - **Competition Saturation Score (1-10):** Assign a score based on the number and quality of existing offerings. A low score indicates an open opportunity. Justify the score.
> - **List of Hyper-Specific Course Topics:** Brainstorm a list of 10-15 potential micro-course topics within the niche that could be created quickly to test the market.

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "Act as a venture capitalist looking for the next breakout star in online education. Identify 'blue ocean' niches where there is clear demand but a lack of high-quality, comprehensive courses. I want ideas that are specific enough to dominate a small market segment quickly."

## Prompt 4: Niche Viability and Business Case 2.0

**Objective:** To build a strong business case for the most promising niches.

**Prompt:**
> "For the top 3 most promising niches (based on their Opportunity Scorecards), build a detailed business case. For each niche, address the following:
> - **Problem-Solution Narrative:** Craft a compelling story that outlines the specific, urgent problems faced by the target audience and how a course in this niche would provide the ideal solution.
> - **Monetization and Pricing Strategy:** Propose a detailed monetization model (e.g., tiered pricing, community access upsell, certification fee). Justify your pricing based on the perceived value and competitor pricing.
> - **Barriers to Entry and Mitigation:** What are the biggest challenges to creating a successful course in this niche (e.g., need for specialized expertise, high production costs, marketing challenges)? Propose concrete strategies to overcome these barriers.
> - **Sustainable Competitive Advantage:** What unique value proposition will make this course difficult to imitate? (e.g., a proprietary teaching methodology, an exclusive community, partnerships with industry experts).

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "Create a 'Course Launch Pitch Deck' for the top 3 niche ideas. The deck should be persuasive enough to secure funding from an investor. It needs to be data-driven, strategic, and clearly articulate the path to profitability."

## Prompt 5: From Idea to Actionable Blueprint 2.0

**Objective:** To transform the validated course idea into a detailed, actionable blueprint for development and launch.

**Prompt:**
> "Synthesize all previous analysis into 3 complete, actionable course blueprints. For each blueprint, provide:
> - **A Magnetic Course Title and Subtitle:** Should be benefit-oriented and keyword-rich.
> - **A Detailed, Modular Course Curriculum:** Break down the course into weekly modules. For each module, list the specific lessons, hands-on projects, and assessments.
> - **The Ideal Student Avatar:** Create a detailed persona of the perfect student, including their goals, struggles, and what they hope to achieve with the course.
> - **A Multi-Channel Marketing and Launch Plan:** Outline a phased launch strategy. Include pre-launch activities (e.g., building an email list, creating lead magnets), launch-week promotions (e.g., early-bird discounts, webinars), and post-launch marketing efforts (e.g., content marketing, social media advertising).
> - **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Define the specific metrics that will be used to measure the success of the course, both during launch and in the long term (e.g., enrollment numbers, completion rate, student satisfaction scores).

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "You are now the 'Head of Product' for a new online course. Create the final 'Product Requirements Document (PRD)' that will guide the entire development and launch process. The PRD should be so detailed that a team of instructors, marketers, and developers can execute it without further clarification."
