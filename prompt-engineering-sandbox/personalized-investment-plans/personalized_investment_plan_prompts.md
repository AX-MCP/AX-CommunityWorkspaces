# LLM Prompt Sequence for Personalized Investment Plans

This document outlines a sequence of prompts to guide an LLM in creating a personalized investment plan for a user.

## Prompt 1: Introduction and Goal Setting

**Goal:** Introduce the LLM and understand the user's financial goals.

**Prompt:**
"Hello! I am a financial assistant powered by a large language model. I can help you create a personalized investment plan. To start, could you please tell me about your primary financial goals? For example, are you saving for retirement, a down payment on a house, your children's education, or something else? Please be as specific as possible about your goals and your desired timeline."

## Prompt 2: Risk Tolerance Assessment

**Goal:** Assess the user's tolerance for investment risk.

**Prompt:**
"Thank you for sharing your goals. Now, let's assess your comfort with investment risk. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being 'very risk-averse' and 5 being 'very comfortable with risk,' how would you rate your risk tolerance?

To help you think about this, consider the following scenarios:

*   **Scenario A (Low Risk):** You invest $10,000. In a good year, you might gain 3-5% ($300-$500). In a bad year, you might lose 1-2% ($100-$200).
*   **Scenario B (Medium Risk):** You invest $10,000. In a good year, you might gain 8-12% ($800-$1200). In a bad year, you might lose 5-10% ($500-$1000).
*   **Scenario C (High Risk):** You invest $10,000. In a good year, you might gain 20-30% ($2000-$3000). In a bad year, you might lose 15-25% ($1500-$2500).

Which of these scenarios are you most comfortable with? Please also share any other thoughts you have about risk."

## Prompt 3: Information Gathering

**Goal:** Gather more financial information from the user.

**Prompt:**
"Great. Understanding your risk tolerance is key. To further personalize your plan, I need a little more information about your financial situation. Please provide the following details:

*   **Age:**
*   **Annual Income:**
*   **Total Savings/Investments:**
*   **Any existing debts (e.g., student loans, credit card debt):**
*   **Your country of residence (for tax and regulatory considerations):**

All the information you provide will be kept confidential and used solely for the purpose of creating your investment plan."

## Prompt 4: Plan Generation
