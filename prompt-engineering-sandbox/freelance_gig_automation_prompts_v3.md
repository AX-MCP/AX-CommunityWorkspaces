# AI Agent Prompts for Freelance Gig Automation (v3)

This document provides a sequence of prompts for an AI agent to automate finding, evaluating, and applying for freelance gigs. This version focuses on creating a personalized and efficient application workflow.

## Prompt 1: Defining the Ideal Gig Profile

**Objective:** To establish a clear and detailed profile of the ideal freelance gig, which will be used to filter and rank opportunities.

**Prompt:**
> "Create a detailed 'Ideal Gig Profile' for a freelance [Your Profession, e.g., Python Developer, Content Writer]. The profile should include:
> - **Core Skills and Technologies:** List the primary skills and technologies required (e.g., Python, Django, FastAPI for a developer; SEO, long-form content, copywriting for a writer).
> - **Project Types:** Describe the preferred types of projects (e.g., web application development, API integration, blog post writing, e-book creation).
> - **Gig Platforms:** Specify the preferred freelance platforms to search (e.g., Upwork, Toptal, Freelancer.com, specific niche job boards).
> - **Red Flags and Dealbreakers:** List criteria that would immediately disqualify a gig (e.g., low budget, unclear scope, negative client reviews, specific industries to avoid).
> - **Budget and Rate Requirements:** Define the minimum acceptable budget or hourly rate.
> - **Client Profile:** Describe the ideal client (e.g., tech startup, marketing agency, individual entrepreneur).

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "You are a career coach for a freelance [Your Profession]. Your first task is to help me build a 'smart filter' for my job search. What are the key parameters we should use to define a 'perfect' freelance opportunity for me?"

## Prompt 2: Automated Gig Search and Aggregation

**Objective:** To automate the process of searching for and aggregating potential freelance gigs from multiple sources.

**Prompt:**
> "Using the 'Ideal Gig Profile' previously created, perform an automated search across the specified freelance platforms. Aggregate the top 10-15 most relevant gig postings from the last 48 hours. For each posting, extract the following information into a structured format (e.g., JSON or a markdown table):
> - **Gig Title**
> - **Platform and URL**
> - **Client's Stated Budget**
> - **Required Skills (as listed in the posting)**
> - **A 'Relevance Score' (1-10):** How well does this gig match the 'Ideal Gig Profile'? Justify the score.
> - **A 'Red Flag Check':** Note any potential red flags based on the profile.

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "Build a 'Daily Digest' of the best new freelance gigs for a [Your Profession]. The digest should be a curated list of opportunities that closely match my skills and preferences. I want to see a quick summary of each gig and a link to the original posting."

## Prompt 3: In-Depth Gig Evaluation and Shortlisting

**Objective:** To perform a deeper evaluation of the aggregated gigs and create a shortlist of the most promising opportunities.

**Prompt:**
> "From the aggregated list of gigs, select the top 3-5 most promising opportunities. For each of these shortlisted gigs, conduct a more in-depth evaluation:
> - **Client History Analysis:** Analyze the client's history on the platform. What is their average rating? How many projects have they completed? What is the sentiment of past freelancer reviews?
> - **Project Description Deconstruction:** Break down the project description. What are the explicit and implicit requirements? Are there any potential ambiguities or scope creep risks?
> - **Question Identification:** Based on the project description, identify 2-3 clarifying questions to ask the client. These questions should demonstrate your expertise and attention to detail.

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "You are my personal 'freelance agent'. I'm sending you a list of potential gigs. I need you to vet them for me. Tell me which ones are worth pursuing and why. I also need you to prep me with some smart questions for the clients."

## Prompt 4: Personalized Proposal Generation

**Objective:** To generate a highly personalized and compelling proposal for each of the shortlisted gigs.

**Prompt:**
> "For each of the shortlisted gigs, generate a personalized proposal. The proposal should be a template that can be quickly customized and submitted. The proposal should include:
> - **A Strong Opening:** Start with a sentence that shows you have read and understood the project requirements.
> - **A 'Why Me' Section:** Briefly explain why you are the perfect fit for this specific project. Reference your most relevant skills and past projects.
> - **Your Proposed Approach:** Outline your high-level approach to the project. This demonstrates your strategic thinking.
> - **The Clarifying Questions:** Include the questions you identified in the previous step.
> - **A Call to Action:** End with a clear call to action, such as inviting the client to a brief chat.

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "Draft a 'winning' proposal for this freelance gig: [Paste Gig Description]. The proposal should be persuasive, professional, and tailored to the client's needs. It should make me stand out from the other applicants."

## Prompt 5: Application Tracking and Follow-up

**Objective:** To create a system for tracking applications and scheduling follow-ups.

**Prompt:**
> "Create a simple application tracking system in a markdown table. The table should have the following columns:
> - **Gig Title**
> - **Platform**
> - **Date Applied**
> - **Status (Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected)**
> - **Next Action (e.g., 'Follow up on [Date]', 'Prepare for interview')**
>
> Additionally, for any application that has not received a response in 3-5 business days, draft a brief, professional follow-up message."

**Alternative Phrasing:**
> "I need a simple CRM to manage my freelance job applications. It should help me keep track of everything I've applied for and remind me when to follow up. Can you set that up for me?"
