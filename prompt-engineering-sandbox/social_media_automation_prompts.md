# LLM Prompt Sequence for Social Media Content Automation

This sequence of prompts is designed to help a small business owner automate their social media content creation process. The prompts guide the LLM to understand the business, create a content calendar, and generate engaging social media posts.

## 1. Define the Business and Goals

**Prompt 1: Business Profile**

```
I need your help creating a social media content calendar for my small business. First, I'll provide you with some information about my business. Please ask me a series of questions to understand my business, my target audience, my brand voice, and my social media goals. Once you have enough information, please summarize it in a "Business Profile" that we can use as a reference for all future content creation.
```

**Prompt 2: Competitor Analysis**

```
Based on the Business Profile we just created, please identify 3-5 competitors in my niche. For each competitor, analyze their social media presence (platforms used, content themes, engagement strategies) and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, suggest opportunities for me to differentiate my brand and provide unique value to my audience.
```

## 2. Create a Content Calendar

**Prompt 3: Content Theme and Pillar Identification**

```
Using the Business Profile and competitor analysis, let's brainstorm some content themes and pillars for my social media. Please suggest 3-5 content pillars that align with my brand and goals. For each pillar, provide a brief description and some example post ideas.
```

**Prompt 4: Monthly Content Calendar**

```
Now, let's create a content calendar for the next month. Please create a table with the following columns: Week, Day, Platform, Content Pillar, Post Idea, Call to Action. Populate the calendar with a mix of content from the pillars we identified. Include a variety of post formats (e.g., images, videos, stories, blog post links).
```

## 3. Generate Social Media Posts

**Prompt 5: Generate a single post**

```
From the content calendar we created, please write a social media post for [Day] of [Week]. The post should be for [Platform] and should be based on the content pillar "[Content Pillar]" and the post idea "[Post Idea]". Remember to use the brand voice we defined in the Business Profile and include the call to action "[Call to Action]". Please also suggest relevant hashtags.
```

**Prompt 6: Generate a week of posts**

```
Please generate all the social media posts for Week [Week Number] of the content calendar. For each post, please include the platform, the full post copy, and relevant hashtags.
```
