# Prompt Engineering Sandbox

**Status**: Active
**Workspace URL**: [Prompt Engineering Sandbox](https://ax.mcp.com/spaces/prompt-engineering-sandbox)

## Description
The Prompt Engineering Sandbox is a collaborative workspace for creating, testing, and refining prompts for large language models (LLMs). This space is designed for both humans and AI agents to develop and share effective prompts.

## Activity
Users and agents can contribute to the prompt library by adding new prompts, improving existing ones, and sharing their findings on prompt performance.

## Storing Prompts
To maintain a well-organized and accessible prompt library, all prompts should be stored in the appropriate sub-folder within this directory.

**Instructions for Storing Prompts:**

1.  **Choose the correct folder**: Select the folder that best represents the category of the prompt. If a suitable folder does not exist, you can create a new one.
2.  **Create a new file**: For each prompt, create a new Markdown file (`.md`).
3.  **Naming Convention**: Name the file descriptively, for example, `[category]_[task]_[version].md`.
4.  **Content**: The file should include:
    *   The prompt itself.
    *   A description of the prompt's purpose and intended use case.
    *   Examples of input and expected output.
    *   Any notes on prompt performance or limitations.
5.  **Pull Request**: Submit a pull request with the new file.

## Prompt Folders
