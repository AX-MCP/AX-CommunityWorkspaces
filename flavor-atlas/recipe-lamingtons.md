# Lamingtons Recipe

A classic Australian dessert featuring sponge cake coated in chocolate icing and desiccated coconut.

**Yields:** 24 squares
**Prep time:** 10 minutes

### Ingredients

**For the Sponge Cake:**
*   2 cups (320g) all-purpose flour
*   4 teaspoons (20g) baking powder
*   ⅛ teaspoon salt
*   ¾ cup (175g) white caster sugar
*   ½ cup (250g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
*   4 large eggs, at room temperature
*   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*   ½ cup (190g) milk

**For the Chocolate Icing:**
*   2½ cups (310g) icing sugar (confectioners' sugar)
*   ⅓ cup (40g) cocoa powder
*   3 tablespoons (45g) butter, melted
*   140ml warm milk

**For Decorating:**
*   1½ cups (145g) desiccated coconut

### Instructions

**1. Prepare the Cake:**
*   Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C) or 375°F (190°C).
*   Grease and flour an 8x12-inch or 9x13-inch cake pan and line it with parchment paper.
*   In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
*   In a separate large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.
*   Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until combined. Mix in the vanilla extract.
*   With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in two batches, alternating with the milk, mixing until just combined after each addition.
*   Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for approximately 25 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when gently pressed.
*   Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. For best results, wrap the cooled cake in plastic wrap and let it firm up at room temperature for 8 hours to overnight.

**2. Make the Icing:**
*   In a large bowl, combine the melted butter and warm milk.
*   Sift in the cocoa powder and icing sugar, then mix until the icing is smooth and fluid, but not too runny. If the icing hardens, add a splash of hot water and stir until it reaches the desired consistency.

**3. Assemble the Lamingtons:**
*   Once the cake is completely chilled, trim the edges and cut it into 24 squares.
*   Set up a work surface by covering it with parchment or wax paper, and place a wire rack over it.
*   Pour the desiccated coconut into a shallow bowl.
*   Using a fork, dip each cake square into the chocolate icing, turning to coat all sides thoroughly.
*   Let any excess icing drain off, then transfer the coated square to the bowl of desiccated coconut. Roll the square in the coconut until fully covered.
*   Place the finished lamingtons onto the wire rack to dry.
*   Refrigerate the lamingtons for about 15 minutes to set the icing.

### Tips
*   **Accurate Measuring:** Weighing flour with a kitchen scale is the most accurate way to avoid a dry sponge cake.
*   **Room Temperature Ingredients:** Ensure eggs and butter are at room temperature for better mixing and a lighter cake.
*   **Fillings:** For an extra treat, cut cooled lamingtons in half horizontally and spread with strawberry or raspberry jam, or even whipped cream, before reassembling.
