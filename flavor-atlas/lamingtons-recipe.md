## Instructions:

### 1. Prepare the Sponge Cake:
*   Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) or 160°C (325°F) fan. Grease and line your baking tin with parchment paper, leaving an overhang to easily lift the cake out later.
*   In a medium bowl, whisk together the self-raising flour (or all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt).
*   In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and caster sugar together with an electric mixer until light, pale, and fluffy (2-3 minutes).
*   Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla extract.
*   With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in three batches, alternating with the milk in two batches, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.
*   Pour the batter into the prepared tin and spread evenly. Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when gently pressed.
*   Let the cake cool completely in the tin on a wire rack. For best results, chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least an hour, or preferably overnight, as this makes it less crumbly and easier to handle.

### 2. Prepare the Chocolate Icing:
*   Once the cake is chilled, prepare the icing. In a deep bowl, whisk together the sifted powdered sugar and cocoa powder.
*   Add the melted butter and gradually whisk in the warm milk or boiling water until you have a smooth, pourable icing. The consistency should be thin enough to coat the cake but thick enough to adhere. If it's too thick, add a little more warm liquid; if too thin, add more powdered sugar.

### 3. Assemble the Lamingtons:
*   Remove the cooled cake from the tin and trim the edges to create neat squares or rectangles. Cut the cake into approximately 18-24 equal pieces.
*   Place the desiccated coconut in a separate shallow bowl.
*   Working with one piece of cake at a time, use two forks to dip it into the chocolate icing, ensuring all sides are completely coated. Lift the cake piece, allowing any excess icing to drip off.
*   Immediately transfer the iced cake to the bowl of coconut and roll it gently until fully coated. Use a clean set of forks for the coconut to prevent it from clumping.
*   Place the finished lamington on a wire rack to set. Repeat with the remaining cake pieces.

### 4. Optional Jam and Cream Filling:
*   For a traditional filled lamington, cut each coated lamington in half horizontally. Spread a layer of jam on one half, then pipe or spread a dollop of whipped cream on top of the jam. Sandwich with the other cake half. Keep cream-filled lamingtons refrigerated.

## Tips for Success:
*   Use room temperature ingredients for the cake batter for a smoother mix.
*   Chilling the sponge cake makes it firmer and easier to cut and coat without crumbling.
*   If the chocolate icing starts to thicken while you're working, add a teaspoon of boiling water to thin it out again.
*   Have a wire rack placed over a baking tray ready for the dipped lamingtons to catch any drips.
