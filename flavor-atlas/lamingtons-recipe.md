## Ingredients

*   4 large eggs
*   2 cups (300g) self-raising flour
*   1/2 cup (125ml) milk
*   1 tsp vanilla extract
*   Pinch of salt

### For the Chocolate Icing:
*   4 cups (500g) powdered sugar (icing sugar)
*   1/2 cup (60g) unsweetened cocoa powder
*   2 tbsp (30g) butter, melted
*   3/4 cup (180ml) boiling water

### For the Coating:
*   3 cups (300g) desiccated coconut

### Optional Fillings:
*   Raspberry or strawberry jam
*   Whipped cream

## Instructions

1.  **Prepare the Sponge Cake:**
    *   Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) or 160°C (320°F) fan-forced. Line a lamington tin (approximately 22cm x 33cm or 8x12 inches) with baking paper.
    *   In a bowl, sift together the flour and salt. Whisk to combine and set aside.
    *   In a separate large bowl, beat the softened butter and caster sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy (about 1.5 to 2 minutes).
    *   Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until combined.
    *   Gradually add half of the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, gently folding to combine. Then, stir in half of the milk and vanilla extract. Repeat with the remaining dry ingredients and milk until just combined.
    *   Pour the batter into the prepared tin and tap lightly on the bench to remove any large bubbles.
    *   Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
    *   Let the cake cool in the tin for 10-15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

2.  **Cut the Cake:**
    *   Once completely cool, place the cake on a cutting board and trim the edges if they are crisp. Cut the cake into 18-24 even squares (about 2-inch or 5cm squares).
    *   **Tip:** Some recipes suggest freezing the cake squares for a short period (e.g., 30 minutes or more) before coating, as a firm, semi-frozen cake is easier to handle.

3.  **Prepare the Chocolate Icing:**
    *   In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, melted butter, and boiling water until smooth. If the icing hardens during coating, add a splash of hot water and stir until it reaches the desired consistency.

4.  **Prepare the Coconut:**
    *   Pour the desiccated coconut into a shallow bowl.

5.  **Assemble the Lamingtons:**
    *   Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place a wire rack on top.
    *   Using a fork, dip each cake square into the chocolate icing, ensuring it's completely covered. Allow any excess icing to drip off.
    *   Immediately roll the chocolate-coated cake square in the desiccated coconut until fully coated.
    *   Place the coated Lamington on the prepared wire rack to set. Repeat with the remaining cake squares.

6.  **Set and Serve:**
    *   Let the Lamingtons dry completely on the wire rack, about 20 minutes, or refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour to set.
    *   Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 to 4 days.

### Optional Jam and Cream Filling:
*   If desired, slice each coated Lamington in half horizontally. Spread a layer of jam (such as raspberry) on one half, then pipe or dollop whipped cream on top. Place the other cake half on top to create a sandwich.
