## Instructions:

### 1. Prepare the Dipping Sauce:
*   In a small saucepan, combine the dashi, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar.
*   Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
*   Remove from heat and set aside.

### 2. Prepare the Batter:
*   In a medium bowl, a lightly beat the egg.
*   Add the ice-cold water to the bowl and stir to combine.
*   Add the sifted flour all at once.
*   Gently mix the batter with chopsticks or a whisk for a few seconds. The batter should be lumpy. Do not overmix.

### 3. Prepare the Ingredients for Frying:
*   Pat the shrimp and vegetables dry with paper towels.
*   Lightly coat the shrimp and vegetables with a thin layer of flour. This will help the batter adhere.

### 4. Fry the Tempura:
*   In your deep fryer or pot, heat the oil to 175°C (350°F).
*   Dip the shrimp and vegetables into the batter, one at a time, and carefully place them in the hot oil.
*   Do not overcrowd the pot. Fry in small batches.
*   Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the batter is golden and crispy.
*   Remove the tempura from the oil with chopsticks or tongs and place them on a wire rack to drain.

### 5. Serve:
*   Serve the tempura hot with the dipping sauce.
*   If desired, add grated daikon radish and ginger to the dipping sauce.

## Tips for Success:
*   Use ice-cold water for the batter. This is the key to making light and crispy tempura.
*   Do not overmix the batter. A lumpy batter is what you want.
*   Make sure the oil is at the correct temperature. If the oil is not hot enough, the tempura will be greasy. If it is too hot, the tempura will burn.
*   Fry the tempura in small batches to avoid overcrowding the pot.
