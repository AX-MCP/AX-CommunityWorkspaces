# Classic Fish and Chips Recipe

This recipe focuses on a traditional fried approach, with tips for achieving crispy fish and perfectly cooked chips.

**Yields:** 4 servings
**Prep time:** 30 minutes (plus resting time for batter and potatoes)
**Cook time:** 20-30 minutes

#### Ingredients

**For the Fish:**
*   1 ½ - 2 pounds thick, white fish fillets (such as cod, haddock, pollock, or mahi-mahi), cut into 1-inch wide pieces
*   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
*   ½ cup all-purpose flour, for dredging

**For the Batter:**
*   1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
*   1 cup cornstarch
*   1-2 teaspoons baking powder
*   ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
*   ½ teaspoon paprika (optional)
*   1 teaspoon salt
*   1 ¼ - 3 cups very cold light beer (such as lager), or sparkling water/club soda

**For the Chips:**
*   3 pounds Russet potatoes (about 4 large), peeled and cut into ½-inch thick sticks
*   3-4 quarts canola oil (or other neutral oil like vegetable oil, or beef tallow for traditional flavor) for frying
*   Salt, to taste

**For Serving:**
*   Lemon wedges
*   Malt vinegar
*   Tartar sauce

#### Instructions

**1. Prepare the Chips (First Fry):**
*   Peel the potatoes and cut them into ½-inch thick sticks. Rinse the cut potatoes under cold water to remove excess starch, then place them in a large bowl of cold water until ready to fry. This helps prevent them from sticking and ensures crispiness.
*   In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat 2-3 quarts of oil over medium heat to 325°F (160°C).
*   Thoroughly drain the potatoes and pat them very dry with paper towels.
*   Carefully fry the potatoes in small batches for 2-3 minutes until pale and softened, but not browned. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Let them cool to room temperature.

**2. Prepare the Fish:**
*   Pat the fish fillets very dry with paper towels. This is crucial for the batter to adhere properly.
*   Season the fish generously with salt and pepper.
*   Dredge each fillet lightly in the ½ cup of all-purpose flour, shaking off any excess.

**3. Make the Batter:**
*   In a large bowl, whisk together the 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, and optional cayenne and paprika.
*   Gradually whisk in the very cold beer (or sparkling water) until you have a slightly thick, smooth batter. The batter should be lumpy, but if it's too thick, add a little more beer, one tablespoon at a time, until it falls from the whisk in a thin, steady stream. Avoid overmixing.
*   Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

**4. Fry the Fish:**
*   Increase the oil temperature in your pot to 350-375°F (175-190°C). Use a thermometer to monitor the oil temperature, as it's key to success.
*   Dip each floured fish fillet into the cold batter, ensuring it's fully coated. Allow any excess batter to drip off.
*   Working in small batches to avoid overcrowding the pot and lowering the oil temperature, carefully lower a few battered fillets into the hot oil.
*   Fry for approximately 5-8 minutes, turning occasionally, until the batter is crisp and golden brown and the fish is cooked through and flakes easily.
*   Remove the fried fish with a slotted spoon and place on a wire rack set over paper towels to drain. Season immediately with a little salt. Keep warm in a low oven (around 200°F/95°C) while you finish frying the chips.

**5. Finish the Chips (Second Fry):**
*   Increase the oil temperature to 400°F (200°C).
*   Fry the par-cooked chips again in small batches for 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp.
*   Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Season immediately with salt.

**6. Serve:**
*   Serve the hot, crispy fish and chips immediately.
*   Accompany with lemon wedges, malt vinegar, and tartar sauce.
