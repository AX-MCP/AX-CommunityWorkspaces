# Lamingtons

Lamingtons are an iconic Australian dessert consisting of squares of sponge cake dipped in a chocolate coating and then rolled in desiccated coconut. They are a popular treat for afternoon tea, picnics, and gatherings.

**Ingredients:**

**For the Sponge Cake:**
*   **Flour:** 1 ¾ cups (260g) self-raising flour
*   **Butter:** ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, softened
*   **Sugar:** 1 cup (200g) caster sugar (superfine sugar)
*   **Eggs:** 3 large eggs, at room temperature
*   **Milk:** ½ cup (120ml) whole milk
*   **Vanilla Extract:** 1-2 teaspoons, good quality

**For the Chocolate Coating:**
*   **Icing Sugar (Powdered Sugar):** 300g
*   **Cocoa Powder:** 35g , unsweetened
*   **Butter:** 30g, melted
*   **Boiling Water:** 150ml

**For Coating:**
*   **Desiccated Coconut:** 2 cups, fine, unsweetened

**Instructions:**

1.  **Prepare the Cake Batter:**
    *   Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
    *   Grease and line a 22cm x 33cm (8x12 inch) rectangular baking tin with baking paper.
    *   In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
    *   Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla extract.
    *   Gradually add the flour alternately with the milk, mixing until just combined.
    *   Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
    *   Let the cake cool completely in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack. For best results, let the cake sit overnight.

2.  **Prepare the Chocolate Coating:**
    *   Sift together the icing sugar and cocoa powder.
    *   Add the melted butter and gradually whisk in the boiling water until you have a smooth, runny glaze.

3.  **Assemble the Lamingtons:**
    *   Cut the cooled cake into 5cm (2-inch) squares.
    *   Place the desiccated coconut in a shallow bowl.
    *   Using two forks, dip a piece of cake into the chocolate coating, covering all sides.
    *   Allow excess chocolate to drip off, then roll the cake in the desiccated coconut.
    *   Place the finished lamington on a wire rack to set.
    *   Repeat with the remaining cake pieces.
    *   Refrigerate for about an hour before serving.

**Optional Additions:**
*   **Jam and Cream:** Slice the sponge squares in half horizontally and spread with raspberry jam and whipped cream.
*   **Toasted Coconut:** Toast the desiccated coconut before coating for extra flavor.
*   **Dark Chocolate Coating:** Add 100g of melted dark chocolate to the icing mixture for a richer chocolate flavor.
