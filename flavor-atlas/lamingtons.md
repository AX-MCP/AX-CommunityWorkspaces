#### **Instructions**

**1. Make the Sponge Cake:**
    *   Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and line an 8x12-inch or 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the cake out later.
    *   In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
    *   In a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the softened butter and superfine sugar together until light and fluffy (about 3-5 minutes).
    *   Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until combined. Stir in the vanilla extract.
    *   With the mixer on low speed, gradually add about a third of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Then add half of the milk, mixing until incorporated. Repeat with another third of the dry ingredients, the remaining milk, and finally the last third of the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.
    *   Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
    *   Let the cake cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, then carefully lift it out using the parchment paper overhang and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

**2. Prepare the Chocolate Icing:**
    *   In a large bowl, whisk together the sifted powdered sugar and cocoa powder.
    *   Add the melted butter and gradually add the boiling water or warm milk, stirring until you have a smooth, pourable icing. If the icing is too thick, add a little more warm water/milk; if too thin, add more powdered sugar. The consistency should be thick enough for coconut to stick, but thin enough to easily coat the cake.

**3. Assemble the Lamingtons:**
    *   Once the cake is completely cool, trim the edges and cut it into 1.5 to 2-inch squares.
    *   **Tip:** For easier handling, freeze the cake squares for about an hour before coating.
    *   Place the desiccated coconut in a shallow dish or bowl.
    *   Working with one cake square at a time, use a fork to dip it into the chocolate icing, turning to coat all sides evenly. Allow any excess icing to drip off.
    *   Immediately transfer the iced cake square to the dish with desiccated coconut. Roll it gently to coat all sides thoroughly.
    *   Place the finished Lamington on a wire rack set over parchment paper to catch any drips.
    *   Repeat with the remaining cake squares.
    *   Refrigerate the Lamingtons for at least 30 minutes to an hour to allow the icing to set.

#### **Tips and Variations**

*   **Room Temperature Ingredients:** Ensure eggs and butter are at room temperature for a smoother batter and better rise.
*   **Weighing Flour:** For accuracy, weigh your flour using a kitchen scale.
*   **Fillings:** For an extra treat, slice a Lamington in half horizontally and spread with strawberry or raspberry jam and/or whipped cream before reassembling.
*   **Storage:** Lamingtons are best stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a few days, or in the refrigerator for longer freshness.
