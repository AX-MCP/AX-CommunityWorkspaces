*This easy Beef Stroganoff can be made in less than 30-minutes and is a delicious, kid-friendly meal your entire family will love!*

I love fast and easy like this stroganoff recipe or [One Pan Baked Ziti](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/one-pan-baked-ziti/) or  [Creamy Tomato and Spinach Tortellini](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/creamy-tomato-spinach-tortellini/)!  And, if you want to make this recipe in the [Instant Pot](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/instant-pot-stroganoff/), I've got you covered!

This simple homemade stroganoff recipe takes me straight back to my childhood. Is it fancy? No. Is it gourmet? Not at all. But, is it something your family (of any age) will happily eat, and ask for seconds? YES!

Stroganoff actually originated in Russia (something I did not know!) and refers to a meal that is made by cooking beef thin strips of beef in a flavorful, sour cream based sauce. I use ground beef in my stroganoff because it's usually what I have on hand, and it's inexpensive and kid-friendly.

## Why I LOVE this recipe:

- **30 minute meal.** This is one of those classic recipes that's perfect for busy weeknights.
- **Ground beef.** Different from other stroganoff recipes but SO delicious, cheap, and easy!
- **Make ahead**. You can make the sauce with the beef ahead of time and cook the noodles right before serving! See my make-ahead instructions below.

If you don't want to use cream of mushroom soup I have linked to my easy [homemade cream of mushroom soup](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/condensed-cream-anything-soup/) recipe. I have also found that Greek yogurt is a great substitution for sour cream!

## How to make beef stroganoff:

- **Brown the beef.** Brown the ground beef and add garlic and onion,
- **Add mushrooms and broth**. Drain the grease from the beef and then add mushrooms and beef broth and let it simmer.

- **Stir in sour cream** and serve over [egg noodles](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/homemade-egg-noodles/).
- **Serve.** This is a go-to quick weeknight meal for our family.

## About the BEEF:

One of the things I love most about this stroganoff recipe is that it's made with ground beef. I don't use steak because I hardly ever have steak sitting around for a dinner like this. *But* I usually always have some ground beef in my freezer just waiting to be used during the crazy dinner rush.

Stroganoff recipes call for all types of beef and you can definitely substitute your favorite type, including:

- Top sirloin
- Beef tenderloin
- Boneless ribeye
- Filet mignon

## What to serve Stroganoff over or with:

- Egg noodles: Store-bought or [homemade egg noodles](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/homemade-egg-noodles/).
- Rice or [Mashed potatoes](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/mashed-potatoes/): both are great alternatives to egg noodles for serving the stroganoff sauce over.
- [Roasted vegetables](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/roasted-vegetables/)
- Green salad

## MAKE AHEAD, STORING AND FREEZING INSTRUCTIONS:

Leftover stroganoff will last in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop.

To make ahead, make the sauce up until the last step of adding the sour cream. Store in the refrigerator for 1-3 days,(depending on the freshness of your ingredients). Reheat on the stovetop over medium-low heat, and stir in the sour cream.

To freeze stroganoff, make the sauce up until the last step of adding the sour cream. Allow the sauce to cool completely, then store in a freezer safe container for 2-3 months. Reheat on the stove top and stir in sour cream once reheated.
