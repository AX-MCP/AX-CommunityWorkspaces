#### Cooking Directions

Cook White Castle® Original Sliders in your microwave two at a time according to package instructions. Set them aside on paper towels or a sheet tray to cool. 2. Once sliders cool, cut into bite-sized pieces and add into a large mixing bowl. 3. Add celery, ground thyme, sage and black pepper into the bowl. 4. Pour chicken broth into bowl and mix well to combine. 5. Transfer stuffing mix to a casserole dish and spread into an even layer. Bake at 350°F for 35 minutes. 6. Remove from oven and let cool, about 5 minutes. Serve warm. NOTE: This recipe makes about 9 cups of stuffing, ideal for a 10-12 lb. turkey. You can scale up this recipe by cooking one slider for each pound of turkey.
