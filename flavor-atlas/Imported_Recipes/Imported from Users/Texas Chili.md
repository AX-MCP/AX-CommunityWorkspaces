***Texas Chili** is the perfect way to feed a hungry crowd and absolutely full of flavor. This recipe is packed with a generous portion of beef (chuck is best) and an interesting array of spices that will lend a touch of sophistication to your Texas chili bowl.*

*Unlike a [classic chili recipe](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/the-best-chili-recipe/) made with ground beef, this recipe doesn’t include beans.* Serve it with a big ol’ [chunk of cornbread](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/homemade-cornbread-recipe/) or [garlic bread](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/homemade-garlic-bread/) for dipping!

It's the perfect chili dinner and great for cookouts or game day! #spendwithpennies #texaschili #chili #chilirecipe #texas #beefchili #easychili")

## What is Texas Chili?

To make Texas chili, you really only need to remember one thing. **No Beans!** Also, keep in mind this regional recipe generally uses only stew beef and not ground beef. Purists will argue that true Texas-style chili is designed to let the flavors of beef and peppers to prevail, and therefore they only use stew beef, chilies, and tomatoes.

But most people spice things up to some degree, and I’m in that camp. This Texas chili has an amazingly rich flavor that comes from not only the beef, but also an unexpected combination of spices and ingredients, including cinnamon, cumin, and even a pinch of unsweetened cocoa!

## Add In Your Favorites

**BEEF for this recipe** can be either stewing beef or chuck. Chuck is uniformly marbled and the tissues break down cooked over low and slow heat until melt in your mouth tender. Stewing beef is another great option but can be made up of various cuts of beef so it doesn’t cook as uniformly.

One of the best things to love about chili is that it lets you exercise your creativity, so go ahead and experiment with all those delightful dried and canned chilies available in specialty grocery stores or even ethnic food aisles. Guajillo, ancho or pasilla peppers are all excellent options.

## To Make Texas Chili

1. Brown the stew beef in an oiled stew pot, then remove and set aside.
2. In the same pot, sauté onions, garlic, and chili peppers.
3. Stir in the seasonings and cook briefly.
4. Add beef and the rest of the ingredients and simmer until very tender.

## Serving Suggestions

By now you know that the best Texas chili recipes contain no beans, but that doesn’t mean you can’t serve them on the side. Keep it simple. Or, mash up some kidney, red and pinto beans, and refry with some butter or lard, garlic powder and other spices. [Spanish rice](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/spanish-rice/) also make an excellent companion dish.

[Cornbread](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/homemade-cornbread-recipe/) should also be considered for dipping or soaking up that spicy sauce. For a tasty finishing touch, top your Texas chili with sour cream or shredded Mexican cheeses.



## Got Leftovers?

**FRIDGE:** Leftovers will keep about 4-5 days in the fridge and easily reheat on the stove top or in the microwave.

**FREEZER:** This recipe freezes perfectly once cooled. Pack it into freezer containers, leaving an inch of headspace for expansion or even freezer bags. It will keep for up to four months. No need to thaw before reheating. Just remove and place in a pot on low heat, and allow to get piping hot before serving.

Prep Time 20

Cook Time 4

Total Time 4 20

Servings 6 servings

Author [Holly Nilsson](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/about-me/)

### Ingredients

- 4 pounds beef chuck roast trimmed of excess fat, cut into ½ inch chunks
- salt and black pepper to taste
- 6 tablespoons [olive oil](https://amzlink.to/az023FSrncaoQ) divided
- 3 jalapeños seeded and diced
- 1 large yellow onion diced
- 5 cloves garlic minced
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce seeded and finely chopped
- 28 ounces crushed tomatoes 1 can
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 4 cups beef stock or broth
- 2 bay leaves

#### Seasoning Mix

- 2 tablespoons [chili powder](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/homemade-chili-powder/)
- 2 tablespoons smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 2 teaspoons chipotle chili powder
- 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon

### Instructions

- Season the beef with kosher salt and black pepper.
- In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat and brown half of the meat. Repeat with remaining beef. Remove from heat and set aside.
- Add remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and heat 30 seconds. Add the jalapeno peppers and onions and saute for about 10 minutes onions are softened. (Do not brown them).
- Stir in garlic and seasoning mix and cook 30 seconds or just until fragrant.
- Add the beef back into the pot along with remaining ingredients.
- Bring the chili to a boil and then turn the heat down to low.
- Simmer, uncovered, for 3 to 3 ½ hours stirring occasionally so it doesn’t stick. If it becomes too thick, add more stock as needed.
- Before serving remove the bay leaves and serve plain or covered with sour cream, shredded cheese, or green onions.

### Notes

If you want to add additional heat, add more chipotle peppers or chipotle chili powder to taste.  
While cooking the meat in the chili should slightly shred - this is normal.
