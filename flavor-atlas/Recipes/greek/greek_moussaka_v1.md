### For the Béchamel Sauce

*   1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter
*   1/2 cup (60g) all-purpose flour
*   4 cups (1L) whole milk, warmed
*   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
*   2 large egg yolks
*   1 cup (100g) grated Parmesan cheese
*   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Prepare the Eggplant

1.  Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2.  Arrange eggplant slices on baking sheets. Sprinkle with salt and let stand for 30 minutes to draw out moisture.
3.  Pat the eggplant slices dry with paper towels. Brush both sides with olive oil.
4.  Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and lightly browned. Set aside.

### Prepare the Meat Sauce

1.  In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground lamb and cook until browned. Drain off any excess fat.
2.  Add the onions and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
3.  Stir in the red wine and cook until it has mostly evaporated.
4.  Add the crushed tomatoes, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper.
5.  Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat and let it cook for 30-45 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened. Remove the bay leaves.

### Prepare the Béchamel Sauce

1.  In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute to form a roux.
2.  Gradually whisk in the warm milk until smooth.
3.  Bring the sauce to a simmer, stirring constantly, until it thickens.
4.  Remove from the heat and stir in the nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
5.  In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Slowly pour a small amount of the hot béchamel sauce into the egg yolks, whisking constantly.
6.  Pour the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the béchamel sauce.
7.  Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth.

### Assemble the Moussaka

1.  Reduce oven temperature to 350°F (175°C).
2.  In a large baking dish, arrange a layer of eggplant slices.
3.  Top with a layer of the meat sauce.
4.  Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce.
5.  Pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the top.
6.  Bake for 45-60 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.
7.  Let it cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.

## Notes

*   For a richer flavor, you can use a combination of ground lamb and beef.
*   The Moussaka can be assembled ahead of time and refrigerated. Bake just before serving.
*   Serve with a simple green salad.
