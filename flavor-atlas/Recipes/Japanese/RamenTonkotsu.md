# Ramen (Tonkotsu)

*A rich and creamy Tonkotsu Ramen with tender chashu pork and a soft-boiled egg.*

## Cultural Context

Tonkotsu ramen is a style of ramen that originated in Fukuoka, Japan. The name "tonkotsu" literally translates to "pork bones," which are the key ingredient in the rich, cloudy broth. The broth is made by boiling pork bones for many hours, which breaks down the collagen and fat and creates a creamy, umami-packed soup.

## Ingredients

**For the Broth:**

*   1.5-2 kg pork bones (femur and neck bones are good)
*   500g pork trotters, split
*   1 onion, halved
*   2-3 green onions, white parts only
*   1 head of garlic, halved crosswise
*   5 cm ginger, sliced

**For the Chashu Pork:**

*   500g pork belly block
*   120ml soy sauce
*   60ml mirin
*   60ml sake
*   30g sugar
*   2 cloves garlic, crushed
*   2.5 cm ginger, sliced

**For the Ramen Eggs (Ajitsuke Tamago):**

*   4 large eggs
*   120ml soy sauce
*   60ml mirin
*   60ml water

**For Serving:**

*   4 portions fresh ramen noodles
*   Green onions, thinly sliced
*   Toasted sesame seeds
*   Nori sheets, cut into squares
*   Menma (bamboo shoots)

### Substitutions

*   **Pork:** If you can't find pork trotters, you can use more pork bones.
*   **Noodles:** You can use dried ramen noodles if you can't find fresh ones.

## Equipment

*   Large stockpot (at least 12 quarts)
*   Fine-mesh sieve
*   Blender (optional, for a creamier broth)

## Instructions

### Preparation (Day 1)

1.  **Prepare the broth:** Place the pork bones and trotters in the stockpot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10-15 minutes to remove impurities. Drain the bones and rinse them under cold water. Clean the pot.
2.  **Simmer the broth:** Return the bones to the pot and cover with fresh cold water. Add the onion, green onions, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Let the broth simmer for 12-18 hours, partially covered, adding more water as needed to keep the bones submerged. The broth should be cloudy and opaque.
3.  **Prepare the chashu pork:** While the broth is simmering, roll the pork belly into a log and tie it with kitchen twine. In a pot, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, garlic, and ginger. Add the pork belly and enough water to cover. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2-3 hours, or until the pork is tender. Let the pork cool in the braising liquid, then refrigerate overnight.
4.  **Prepare the ramen eggs:** Bring a pot of water to a boil. Gently lower the eggs into the water and cook for 6-7 minutes for a soft-boiled yolk. Immediately transfer the eggs to an ice bath to stop the cooking. Once cool, peel the eggs and place them in a container with the soy sauce, mirin, and water. Let them marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight.

### Assembly (Day 2)

1.  **Finish the broth:** Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve. For a creamier broth, you can use an immersion blender to emulsify the fat. Season the broth with salt to taste.
2.  **Cook the noodles:** Cook the ramen noodles according to the package instructions.
3.  **Assemble the ramen:** Slice the chashu pork. Halve the ramen eggs. Divide the hot broth among four bowls. Add the cooked noodles. Top with slices of chashu pork, a ramen egg, green onions, sesame seeds, nori, and menma.

## Food Safety & Storage

*   **Storage:** The broth can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. The chashu pork and ramen eggs can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

## Serving Suggestions

*   Serve with a side of gyoza or a small bowl of rice.

## Scaling Notes

*   This recipe is time-consuming but can be scaled up to make a larger batch of broth, which can be frozen for later use.

## Chef's Notes

*   The key to a good tonkotsu broth is a long, slow simmer. Don't rush this step.
*   The chashu pork and ramen eggs are best made a day in advance to allow the flavors to develop.
