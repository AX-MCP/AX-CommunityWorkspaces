*A classic Japanese Maki Roll with fresh fish and vegetables.*

## Cultural Context

Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as *shari*, or *sumeshi*. Maki rolls, or *makizushi*, are a type of sushi where the rice and fillings are rolled in a sheet of nori (seaweed).

## Ingredients

**For the Sushi Rice:**

*   360g sushi rice
*   480ml water
*   60ml rice vinegar
*   30g sugar
*   15g salt

**For the Filling (example):**

*   225g sushi-grade tuna or salmon, cut into thin strips
*   1/2 cucumber, julienned
*   1/2 avocado, sliced
*   4-6 sheets of nori

**For Serving:**

*   Soy sauce
*   Wasabi
*   Pickled ginger

### Substitutions

*   **Fish:** You can use any sushi-grade fish, or even cooked shrimp or crab. For a vegetarian option, use more vegetables like bell peppers or carrots.
*   **Vegetables:** Feel free to experiment with other vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, or asparagus.

## Equipment

*   Rice cooker
*   Large, non-metallic bowl for mixing rice
*   Bamboo sushi rolling mat (*makisu*)
*   Sharp knife

## Instructions

### Preparation

1.  **Cook the rice:** Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to your rice cooker's instructions.
2.  **Season the rice:** In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Warm over low heat until the sugar and salt have dissolved.
3.  **Cool the rice:** Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to the large bowl. While the rice is still hot, pour the vinegar mixture over it and gently fold it in with a rice paddle. Be careful not to mash the rice. Let the rice cool to room temperature.
4.  **Prepare the fillings:** While the rice is cooling, prepare your fillings by cutting the fish and vegetables into long, thin strips.

### Assembly

1.  **Set up your rolling station:** Place the bamboo rolling mat on a clean surface. Place a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the mat.
2.  **Add the rice:** Wet your hands in a bowl of water to prevent the rice from sticking. Take a handful of rice and spread it evenly over the nori, leaving a 2.5 cm (1-inch) border at the top edge.
3.  **Add the fillings:** Arrange your fillings in a line across the center of the rice.
4.  **Roll the sushi:** Using the bamboo mat, lift the edge of the nori closest to you and roll it over the fillings. Tightly roll the sushi away from you, using the mat to shape the roll.
5.  **Seal the roll:** Lightly wet the border of the nori with water to seal the roll.

### Finishing

1.  **Slice the roll:** Using a very sharp, wet knife, slice the roll into 8 pieces.
2.  **Serve:** Arrange the sushi on a platter and serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.

## Food Safety & Storage

*   **Food Safety:** It is crucial to use sushi-grade fish, which has been frozen to kill any potential parasites.
*   **Storage:** Sushi is best eaten fresh. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. The rice will harden in the refrigerator.

## Serving Suggestions

*   Serve with a bowl of miso soup and a side of edamame.

## Scaling Notes

*   This recipe can be easily scaled up or down.

## Chef's Notes

*   Don't overfill your rolls, as this will make them difficult to roll and they may fall apart.
*   To get clean slices, wipe your knife with a damp cloth between each cut.
