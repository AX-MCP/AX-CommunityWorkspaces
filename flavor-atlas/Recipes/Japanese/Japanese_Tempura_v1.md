## Cultural Context
Tempura is a classic Japanese dish of lightly battered and deep-fried seafood and vegetables. Its origins can be traced back to the 16th century with the arrival of Portuguese missionaries and traders in Nagasaki. The Portuguese introduced the technique of deep-frying, which the Japanese adapted and perfected into the delicate and refined dish we know today.

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 225 g (8 oz / 1.5 cups) All-purpose flour
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 240 ml (8 fl oz / 1 cup) Ice-cold water
- 450 g (1 lb) Large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 450 g (1 lb) Assorted vegetables (e.g., sweet potato, broccoli, bell pepper, onion), sliced

### For the Dipping Sauce (Tentsuyu)
- 120 ml (4 fl oz / 0.5 cup) Dashi stock
- 60 ml (2 fl oz / 0.25 cup) Soy sauce
- 60 ml (2 fl oz / 0.25 cup) Mirin

**Substitutions:**
- All-purpose flour → Cake flour for an even lighter and crispier batter.

## Equipment
- Deep-fryer or large, heavy-bottomed pot
- Cooking thermometer
- Tongs or long chopsticks
- Wire rack

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 15 min)
1.  **Prepare the dipping sauce:** In a small saucepan, combine the dashi, soy sauce, and mirin. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then remove from heat and set aside.
2.  **Prepare the vegetables and shrimp:** Wash and pat dry all vegetables and shrimp. Slice the vegetables into bite-sized pieces. Make a few small incisions on the belly side of each shrimp to prevent curling during frying.

### Cooking (Active time: 15 min)
3.  **Heat the oil:** Pour about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil into your deep-fryer or pot. Heat the oil to 180°C (350°F). Use a cooking thermometer to monitor the temperature.
4.  **Make the batter:** In a medium bowl, lightly whisk the egg and ice-cold water together. Add the flour all at once and mix lightly with chopsticks or a fork. The batter should be lumpy; do not overmix.
5.  **Fry the ingredients:** Dip the vegetables and shrimp into the batter, one piece at a time, ensuring they are lightly coated. Carefully place them into the hot oil, a few pieces at a time. Do not overcrowd the pot. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side, until light golden and crispy.
6.  **Drain the tempura:** Remove the tempura from the oil with tongs or chopsticks and place them on a wire rack to drain excess oil.

### Assembly & Finishing
7.  **Serve immediately:** Arrange the tempura on a serving platter.
8.  **Serve with dipping sauce:** Serve hot with the prepared tentsuyu dipping sauce.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Minimum safe internal temperature:** 74°C (165°F) for shrimp
- **Storage:** Tempura is best eaten fresh. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
- **Freezing:** Not recommended as the tempura will lose its crispiness.
- **Reheating:** Reheat in an oven or air fryer at 180°C (350°F) for a few minutes until crispy.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve with a side of grated daikon radish and ginger to add to the dipping sauce.
- A bowl of steamed rice is a classic accompaniment.

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** The recipe can be easily halved.
**Double recipe (2×):** If doubling, fry in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot and lowering the oil temperature.

## Chef's Notes
- **Sourcing:** Use the freshest seafood and vegetables you can find.
- **Make-ahead:** The dipping sauce can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator.
- **Variations:** You can use a variety of other ingredients for tempura, such as mushrooms, green beans, and fish fillets.
- **Common pitfalls:** Overmixing the batter will result in a heavy and dense tempura. The oil temperature is crucial; if it's too low, the tempura will be greasy, and if it's too high, it will burn before cooking through.
