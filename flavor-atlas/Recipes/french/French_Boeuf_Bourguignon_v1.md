## Cultural Context
Boeuf Bourguignon is a quintessential French dish originating from the Burgundy region (Bourgogne) in France. Traditionally a peasant dish, it was a way to slow-cook tough cuts of beef into a tender, flavorful meal. Its fame was widely popularized by Julia Child, who featured it in her cookbook "Mastering the Art of French Cooking." It represents the heart of French home cooking and is a staple in bistros worldwide.

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 226g (1/2 lb) thick-cut bacon or lardons, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1.4kg (3 lbs) beef chuck, trimmed of fat and cut into 2-inch cubes
- 1-2 tablespoons olive oil (if needed)
- 1 large white or yellow onion, chopped
- 2-3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks
- 5-6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 65g (1/2 cup) all-purpose flour
- 720ml (3 cups) dry red wine (Burgundy, Pinot Noir, or Côtes du Rhône)
- 480-720ml (2-3 cups) beef broth or stock
- 1 bay leaf
- 4-8 sprigs fresh thyme

### For the Garnish
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or 1 1/2 tablespoons butter
- 450g (1 lb) cremini or white button mushrooms, quartered
- 18-24 small pearl onions, peeled
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Fresh parsley, chopped

**Substitutions:**
- Beef chuck → Beef brisket or round steak (braising time may need adjustment)
- Pearl onions → Shallots, quartered

## Equipment
- Large Dutch oven or oven-safe pot
- Skillet
- Slotted spoon
- Wooden spoon

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 20 min)
1. **Prepare Bacon:** In a large Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until crispy (7-10 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the rendered fat.
2. **Sear Beef:** Pat the beef cubes dry and season with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour. Increase heat to medium-high and sear the beef in batches until well-browned on all sides. Do not overcrowd the pot. Set aside with the bacon.

3. **Sauté Vegetables:** Reduce heat to medium. Add onions and carrots and cook until softened (5-7 minutes). Add garlic and tomato paste, cooking for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

### Cooking (Active time: 25 min)
4. **Deglaze and Braise:** Sprinkle remaining flour over the vegetables and stir. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Pour in the red wine, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen browned bits. Add beef broth, bay leaf, and thyme. Bring to a simmer.
5. **Oven Braise:** Return the beef and bacon to the pot. Cover and transfer to a preheated oven at 160-175°C (325-350°F). Braise for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the beef is fork-tender.
6. **Prepare Garnish:** About 30 minutes before the stew is done, melt butter and oil in a skillet. Add mushrooms and cook until browned (8-10 minutes). Add pearl onions and cook for another 5-10 minutes until tender. Season with salt and pepper.

### Assembly & Finishing
7. **Combine and Finish:** Remove the Dutch oven from the oven. Stir in the cooked mushrooms and pearl onions. Remove bay leaf and thyme sprigs. Adjust seasoning.
8. **Garnish and serve:** Let the stew rest for 10-15 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Minimum safe internal temperature:** 63°C (145°F) for beef
- **Storage:** Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
- **Freezing:** Yes, freezes well for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.
- **Reheating:** Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve with mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or crusty bread.
- Pairs well with a full-bodied red wine from Burgundy.

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** Use a smaller pot if available. Braising time may be slightly shorter.
**Double recipe (2×):** Sear the beef in more batches to ensure proper browning. Use a larger Dutch oven.

## Chef's Notes
- **Sourcing:** Use a good quality beef chuck for the best flavor and texture.
- **Make-ahead:** The flavor improves if made a day ahead. Reheat gently.
- **Common pitfalls:** Not drying the beef properly, which prevents good searing. Overcrowding the pot.
