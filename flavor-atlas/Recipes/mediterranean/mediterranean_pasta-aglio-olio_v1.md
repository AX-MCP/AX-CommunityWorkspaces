## Cultural Context
Spaghetti Aglio e Olio (meaning "spaghetti with garlic and oil") is a traditional Italian pasta dish originating from the Naples region. It is a classic example of "cucina povera" (poor kitchen), making the most of simple, inexpensive, and readily available ingredients. Its beauty lies in its simplicity, and it is a testament to the Italian philosophy that high-quality ingredients can speak for themselves.

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 450g (1 lb) spaghetti
- 120ml (1/2 cup) extra virgin olive oil
- 6-8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (or to taste)
- Salt to taste
- 120g (1/2 cup) fresh parsley, chopped

### For the Garnish (Optional)
- 50g (1/2 cup) grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 lemon, for juice

**Substitutions:**
- Spaghetti → Linguine or other long pasta
- Parmesan cheese → Pecorino Romano for a sharper flavor

## Equipment
- Large pot
- Large skillet
- Tongs

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 5 min)
1. **Prepare the ingredients:** Thinly slice the garlic cloves. Chop the fresh parsley. Grate the Parmesan cheese if using.

### Cooking (Active time: 20 min)
2. **Cook the pasta:** Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water before draining.
3. **Sauté the garlic:** While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the garlic is fragrant and lightly golden. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it will become bitter.
4. **Combine and emulsify:** Transfer the drained pasta to the skillet with the garlic and oil. Add about 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water. Toss everything together for about 2 minutes, until the pasta is well-coated and the sauce has emulsified into a creamy consistency. If the sauce is too dry, add more pasta water.
5. **Finish and serve:** Remove from heat. Stir in the chopped parsley. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, if desired.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Storage:** Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
- **Reheating:** Reheat in a skillet over low heat with a splash of water to loosen the sauce.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve as a light main course or as a side dish.
- Pairs well with a crisp white wine like Pinot Grigio.

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** No special considerations.
**Double recipe (2×):** Use a larger skillet to ensure the pasta has enough room to be properly tossed and coated with the sauce.

## Chef's Notes
- **Sourcing:** Use a high-quality extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor.
- **Make-ahead:** The garlic can be sliced and the parsley chopped ahead of time.
- **Common pitfalls:** The most common mistake is burning the garlic. Cook it low and slow to release its flavor without bitterness.
