## Cultural Context
Coq au Vin, literally "rooster in wine," is a classic French dish with peasant origins in the Burgundy region. It was traditionally a slow-braise method to tenderize a tough, old rooster in red wine, transforming it into a rich and flavorful stew. Today, it's a celebrated bistro classic, representing the heart of French home cooking.

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs) chicken pieces (thighs and drumsticks recommended), bone-in, skin-on
- 1 bottle (750 ml) dry, fruity red wine (like Burgundy, Pinot Noir, or Merlot)
- 200 g (7 oz) lardons or thick-cut bacon, diced
- 250 g (9 oz) cremini mushrooms, quartered
- 250 g (9 oz) pearl onions, peeled
- 2 large carrots, chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 60 ml (1/4 cup) brandy or cognac (optional)
- 500 ml (2 cups) chicken stock
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### For the Garnish
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped

**Substitutions:**
- Lardons → Pancetta or thick-cut smoked bacon
- Pearl onions → Shallots, halved or quartered

## Equipment
- Large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot
- Slotted spoon
- Small bowl

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 20 min)
1. **Marinate the chicken (optional but recommended):** Place chicken pieces in a large bowl. Pour the red wine over the chicken, ensuring it's mostly submerged. Add the chopped carrots, celery, yellow onion, and garlic. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.
2. **Prepare the ingredients:** If you marinated the chicken, remove it from the wine, pat it dry with paper towels, and reserve the marinade. Strain the vegetables from the marinade and set them aside. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.

### Cooking (Active time: 25 min)
3. **Render the lardons:** In the Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the lardons until crisp, about 8-10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pot.
4. **Sear the chicken:** Increase heat to medium-high. Working in batches, place the chicken skin-side down in the hot fat. Sear until golden brown on all sides, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.
5. **Sauté the aromatics:** Add the reserved marinated vegetables (or fresh chopped carrots, celery, onion) to the pot. Cook until softened and lightly browned, about 8-10 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
6. **Deglaze and build the sauce:** If using, pour in the brandy/cognac, stand back, and carefully ignite it to burn off the alcohol. Once the flames subside, sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to cook for 1 minute. Slowly pour in the reserved wine marinade (or fresh wine) and the chicken stock, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
7. **Braise the stew:** Return the seared chicken and rendered lardons to the pot. Add the thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, then. Then, reduce heat to low, cover, and let it gently braise for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the chicken is tender and falling off the bone.
8. **Cook the garnish:** While the stew simmers, melt the butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms and cook until softened and caramelized, about 10-15 minutes. Set aside.

### Assembly & Finishing
9. **Thicken the sauce:** Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot. Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. If the sauce is too thin, increase the heat and let it reduce for 10-15 minutes. For a smoother sauce, you can strain out the braising vegetables.
10. **Combine and serve:** Return the chicken to the pot and add the cooked mushrooms and pearl onions. Gently stir to combine and heat through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Minimum safe internal temperature:** 74°C (165°F) for chicken
- **Storage:** Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The flavor often improves the next day.
- **Freezing:** Yes, Coq au Vin freezes well. Cool completely, store in a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.
- **Reheating:** Gently reheat on the stovetop over low heat until warmed through.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve with creamy mashed potatoes, crusty bread, or buttered egg noodles to soak up the sauce.
- Pairs well with the same red wine used for cooking, such as a Burgundy or Pinot Noir.

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** Use a smaller pot. Braising time may be slightly reduced.
**Double recipe (2×):** Use a larger pot or two separate pots. Searing will need to be done in more batches. Ensure you have enough wine and stock to cover the chicken.

## Chef's Notes
- **Sourcing:** A good quality, young red wine is key. It doesn't need to be expensive, but it should be something you'd enjoy drinking.
- **Make-ahead:** The dish is an excellent make-ahead meal, as the flavors meld and deepen overnight.
- **Variations:** Some recipes use white wine (Coq au Vin Blanc) or add a splash of cream at the end for a richer sauce.
- **Common pitfalls:** Don't skip searing the chicken; it builds essential flavor. Be careful not to boil the stew, a gentle simmer is all that's needed.
