## Cultural Context
Ratatouille is a classic vegetable stew originating from the Provence region of France, specifically from Nice. It was traditionally a peasant's dish made with summer vegetables. The name "ratatouille" comes from the Occitan word "ratatolha," which means "to stir up." While the modern version often features artfully arranged sliced vegetables, the original was a simple, rustic dish.

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 2 medium eggplants, thinly sliced
- 2 medium zucchinis, thinly sliced
- 2 medium yellow squashes, thinly sliced
- 4 large Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### For the Garnish
- Fresh basil leaves
- Extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling

**Substitutions:**
- Yellow squash → Bell peppers (any color), for a slightly different flavor profile.

## Equipment
- 12-inch oven-safe skillet or a 9x13-inch baking dish
- Mandoline slicer (optional, for uniform vegetable slices)
- Large bowl

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 20 min)
1. **Prepare the vegetables:** Thinly slice the eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, and Roma tomatoes to a uniform thickness, about 1/8-inch. A mandoline is helpful here. Set aside.
2. **Sauté aromatics:** In the skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

### Cooking (Active time: 25 min)
3. **Make the base:** Pour the crushed tomatoes into the skillet with the onions and garlic. Season with salt, pepper, thyme, and rosemary. Stir to combine and let it simmer for 5 minutes.
4. **Arrange the vegetables:** Arrange the sliced vegetables on top of the tomato sauce in an alternating pattern, creating a spiral. Start from the outer edge and work your way to the center.
5. **Bake:** Drizzle the vegetables with olive oil and season with more salt and pepper. Cover the skillet with a lid or foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 40-50 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.

### Assembly & Finishing
6. **Broil (optional):** For a bit of color, you can remove the cover and broil for the last 5 minutes of cooking.
7. **Garnish and serve:** Garnish with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil before serving.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Storage:** Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 4 days. The flavors will meld and often taste even better the next day.
- **Freezing:** Yes, you can freeze ratatouille for up to 3 months.
- **Reheating:** Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve as a main course with crusty bread or as a side dish.
- It's also delicious with pasta, rice, or quinoa.

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** Use a smaller skillet (8-inch) or baking dish.
**Double recipe (2×):** Use a larger baking dish or two skillets. Baking time may need to be adjusted.

## Chef's Notes
- **Sourcing:** Use the freshest, in-season vegetables for the best flavor.
- **Make-ahead:** Ratatouille can be made a day or two in advance.
- **Variations:** Some recipes call for a layer of bell peppers in the base sauce.
