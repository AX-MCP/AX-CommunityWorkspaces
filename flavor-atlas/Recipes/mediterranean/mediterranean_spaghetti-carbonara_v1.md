## Cultural Context
Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish from Rome. The name is believed to have come from "carbonaro," the Italian word for charcoal burner. It's a simple dish, traditionally made with guanciale (cured pork cheek), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper.

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 400g (14 oz) spaghetti
- 150g (5 oz) guanciale, cut into small cubes
- 4 large egg yolks
- 50g (1.75 oz) Pecorino Romano cheese, freshly grated, plus more for serving
- Freshly ground black pepper

**Substitutions:**
- Guanciale → Pancetta or bacon (note: this will change the flavor profile)
- Pecorino Romano → Parmesan cheese (note: this will make the dish less salty and sharp)

## Equipment
- Large pot for boiling pasta
- Skillet
- Large bowl

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 10 min)
1. **Cook the guanciale:** In a cold skillet, add the guanciale and cook over medium heat until the fat has rendered and the meat is crispy. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Remove the guanciale from the skillet and set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.
2. **Prepare the egg mixture:** In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Season generously with black pepper.

### Cooking (Active time: 10 min)
3. **Cook the pasta:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente.
4. **Combine:** Before draining the pasta, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water. Drain the pasta and immediately add it to the skillet with the rendered guanciale fat. Toss to coat.

### Assembly & Finishing
5. **Create the sauce:** Slowly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, stirring quickly and constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water until it reaches the desired consistency.
6. **Serve:** Add the cooked guanciale back to the pasta and toss to combine. Serve immediately, with extra Pecorino Romano cheese and black pepper on top.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Storage:** Carbonara is best eaten immediately. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, but the sauce will not be as creamy when reheated.
- **Freezing:** Not recommended.
- **Reheating:** Reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of water or milk to loosen the sauce. Do not microwave.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve with a simple green salad.
- Pairs well with a crisp white wine like Pinot Grigio.

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** Use a smaller pot and skillet.
**Double recipe (2×):** Use a larger pot and skillet. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan when cooking the guanciale.

## Chef's Notes
- **Sourcing:** Guanciale can be found at Italian specialty stores or online.
- **Technique:** The key to a creamy carbonara is to use the residual heat of the pasta to cook the eggs. Do not apply direct heat to the egg and cheese mixture.
