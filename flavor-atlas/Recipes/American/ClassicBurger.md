## Ingredients

### Main Components
*   1.5 lbs ground beef (80/20 chuck is ideal)
*   4 burger buns, preferably brioche
*   4 slices of cheddar cheese
*   1 large onion, sliced
*   1 large tomato, sliced
*   4 leaves of lettuce (iceberg or romaine)
*   Dill pickles, sliced
*   Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise
*   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
*   1 tablespoon vegetable oil

### Garnishes
*  None

### Ingredient Substitutions
*   **Beef:** Ground turkey or a plant-based alternative can be used.
*   **Cheese:** Provolone, swiss, or american cheese are great alternatives.
*   **Buns:** Potato rolls or sesame seed buns work well.

## Equipment

### Essential
*   Large skillet or cast-iron pan
*   Spatula
*   Griddle (optional)

## Instructions

### Preparation
1.  **Prepare the Patties:**
    *   Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions.
    *   Gently form each portion into a patty about 3/4-inch thick. Don't overwork the meat.
    *   Press a small indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb. This will prevent the burgers from puffing up in the middle as they cook.
    *   Season both sides of the patties generously with salt and pepper.

### Cooking
1.  **Cook the Burgers:**
    *   Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat.
    *   Place the patties in the hot pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Adjust the cooking time to your desired level of doneness.
    *   During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on top of each patty and let it melt.
2.  **Toast the Buns:**
    *   While the burgers are cooking, lightly toast the cut sides of the burger buns on a separate griddle or in the same pan.

### Assembly & Finishing
1.  **Assemble the Burgers:**
    *   Spread your desired condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) on the toasted buns.
    *   Place a cooked cheeseburger on each bottom bun.
    *   Top with onion, tomato, lettuce, and pickles.
    *   Place the top bun on and serve immediately.

## Food Safety & Storage

*   **Safe Internal Temperature:** Ground beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C).
*   **Refrigeration:** Leftover burgers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
*   **Freezing:** Cooked patties can be frozen for up to 3 months.
*   **Reheating:** Reheat burgers in a skillet or microwave until warmed through.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve with a side of french fries, onion rings, or a simple salad.

## Scaling Notes

This recipe can be easily halved or doubled.

## Chef's Notes

*   **Don't overwork the meat:** Overworking the ground beef will result in tough burgers. Handle the meat as little as possible when forming the patties.
*   **High heat is key:** A hot pan will give your burgers a delicious crust.
*   **Let it rest:** Let the burgers rest for a minute or two before serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the patty.
*   **Customize it:** Feel free to add your favorite toppings, such as bacon, sautéed mushrooms, or a fried egg.
