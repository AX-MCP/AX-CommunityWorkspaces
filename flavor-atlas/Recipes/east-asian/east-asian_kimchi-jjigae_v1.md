## Cultural Context
Kimchi Jjigae is one of the most loved dishes in Korean cuisine, a staple comfort food found in homes and restaurants alike. It is a spicy, savory stew made primarily with ripened kimchi, pork, and tofu. Historically, it was a way to use up aged, sour kimchi that was too pungent to eat raw, transforming it into a rich, deep-flavored broth. It is often shared at the table, served bubbling hot with a bowl of steamed rice.

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 450 g (1 lb / 2 cups) Aged Kimchi (sour), chopped - *Essential: use old, sour kimchi for depth*
- 225 g (8 oz) Pork belly or pork shoulder, sliced into bite-sized pieces
- 1 package (approx. 400g / 14 oz) Firm or medium-firm tofu, sliced into 1cm thick rectangles
- 1/2 medium Onion, sliced
- 2 stalks Green onion, sliced diagonally
- 60 ml (1/4 cup) Kimchi brine (liquid from the kimchi jar)
- 475 ml (2 cups) Water or anchovy kelp stock (stock preferred for better flavor)

### For the Seasoning
- 1 tbsp Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) - *Adjust for spice level*
- 1 tbsp Gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 1 tbsp Soy sauce (soup soy sauce or regular)
- 1 tsp Sugar (to balance the sourness of the kimchi)
- 1 tbsp Minced garlic
- 1 tsp Minced ginger
- 1 tsp Sesame oil

**Substitutions:**
- Pork belly → Canned tuna (add at the end) or Spam (common modern variation)
- Anchovy stock → Rice water (water used to rinse rice) or Chicken stock
- Gochugaru → Crushed red pepper flakes (different flavor profile, but workable in a pinch)

## Equipment
- Medium pot or Ttukbaegi (Korean earthenware pot)
- Cutting board and knife
- Ladle

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 10 min)
1. **Prep the ingredients:** Slice the pork belly and kimchi into bite-sized pieces. Slice the tofu, onion, and green onions.

2. **Make the base:** In a bowl, mix the kimchi and pork belly with the minced garlic, ginger, and sesame oil. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes while you prepare the stock if not already ready.

### Cooking (Active time: 10 min)
3. **Sauté the base:** Heat your pot over medium heat. Add the kimchi and pork mixture. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until the kimchi softens and the pork is cooked through. You should smell the savory aroma of fried kimchi.

4. **Simmer the stew:** Pour in the kimchi brine and water (or stock). Add the onion, gochugaru, gochujang, soy sauce, and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.

5. **Cook through:** Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer for 15-20 minutes to let the flavors meld. The broth should turn a deep, rich red.

### Assembly & Finishing
6. **Add Tofu:** Uncover and gently lay the tofu slices on top of the stew. Simmer for another 5 minutes until the tofu is heated through and absorbs some of the broth.

7. **Garnish and serve:** Top with sliced green onions. Turn off the heat. Serve immediately, ideally in the cooking pot if using earthenware, with a side of steamed white rice.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Minimum safe internal temperature:** 145°F (63°C) for pork
- **Storage:** Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The flavor often improves the next day.
- **Freezing:** Can be frozen, but tofu texture may change (become spongy). Remove tofu before freezing if desired.
- **Reheating:** Reheat on the stove over medium heat until bubbling.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve with steamed short-grain white rice.
- Pairs well with other banchan (side dishes) like seasoned bean sprouts, spinach, or rolled omelet (Gyeran-mari).
- Traditional serving style: Shared from a central pot or served in individual ttukbaegi.

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** Use a smaller pot. Cooking times remain similar, but watch for evaporation.

**Double recipe (2×):** Use a large dutch oven or stockpot. Increase simmering time by 5-10 minutes to ensure depth of flavor.

## Chef's Notes
- **Sourcing:** Look for "Mat Kimchi" or whole cabbage kimchi at Asian grocery stores. If buying fresh, leave it out at room temperature for a day or two to ferment and sour before using for stew.
- **Make-ahead:** The stew tastes even better the next day as the flavors have more time to meld.
- **Variations:** Add mushrooms (enoki or shiitake) or glass noodles for extra texture.
- **Common pitfalls:** Using fresh kimchi will result in a flat, cabbage soup taste. If you must use fresh kimchi, add a splash of vinegar to mimic the sourness.
