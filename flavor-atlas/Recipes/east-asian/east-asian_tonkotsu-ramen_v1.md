## Cultural Context
Tonkotsu ramen is a style of ramen that originated in Fukuoka, Japan. The name "tonkotsu" literally translates to "pork bone," which is the key ingredient in its signature rich and creamy broth. The broth is prepared by boiling pork bones for many hours until the collagen and fat break down, resulting in a milky, umami-rich soup. This dish has become a beloved comfort food both in Japan and internationally.

## Ingredients

### For the Broth
* 2 lbs pork bones (trotters, femurs, and/or neck bones)
* 1 lb pork fatback (optional)
* 1 large onion, roughly chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, smashed
* 2-inch piece of ginger, sliced
* 1 bunch of scallions (white parts)
* 12 cups water

### For the Tare
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup mirin
* 2 tbsp sake
* 1 piece of kombu (dried kelp)
* 1/4 cup bonito flakes (katsuobushi)

### For the Toppings
* 1 lb chashu pork, sliced
* 4 soft-boiled eggs (Ajitama)
* 1/2 cup menma (braised bamboo shoots)
* 4 sheets nori (dried seaweed)
* 1/2 cup sliced scallions (green parts)
* 1/4 cup wood ear mushrooms (kikurage), sliced

### For the Noodles
* 4 servings fresh or dried ramen noodles

## Equipment
* Large stockpot
* Fine-mesh strainer
* Cheesecloth
* Small saucepan
* Noodle-cooking pot

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 30 min)
1. **Clean the bones:** Place pork bones in the stockpot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes, then drain and rinse the bones thoroughly under cold water.

2. **Char the aromatics:** In a dry skillet over high heat, char the onion, garlic, and ginger until blackened in spots.

### Cooking the Broth (Active time: 30 min, Total time: 10-12 hours)
3. **First boil:** Return the cleaned bones to the stockpot with the charred aromatics and scallion whites. Add 12 cups of water and bring to a rolling boil. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface.
4. **Simmer:** Reduce heat to maintain a strong simmer (not a rolling boil) and cook for 10-12 hours, partially covered. Top up with hot water as needed to keep the bones submerged. The broth should become opaque and creamy.

5. **Strain the broth:** Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth. Discard the solids.

### Making the Tare (Active time: 10 min)
6. **Combine ingredients:** In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, and sake with the kombu. Bring to a near-boil, then remove from heat.
7. **Steep and strain:** Add the bonito flakes and let them steep for 10 minutes. Strain the tare.

### Assembly & Finishing (Active time: 15 min)
8. **Cook the noodles:** Cook the ramen noodles according to package directions.
9. **Assemble the bowl:** For each serving, add 2-3 tablespoons of tare to a warmed ramen bowl. Pour 1.5-2 cups of hot broth over the tare and mix well. Add the cooked noodles.
10. **Garnish and serve:** Top with slices of chashu pork, a soft-boiled egg, menma, nori, scallions, and wood ear mushrooms. Serve immediately.

## Food Safety & Storage
* **Minimum safe internal temperature:** N/A
* **Storage:** Store broth in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
* **Freezing:** The broth freezes very well.
* **Reheating:** Reheat the broth on the stovetop over medium heat until hot.

## Serving Suggestions
* Serve with a side of gyoza or pickled ginger.
* Pairs well with a crisp lager or sake.

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** Halve all ingredients. Cooking time for the broth remains the same.
**Double recipe (2×):** Double all ingredients. You will need a very large stockpot. Cooking time for the broth remains the same.

## Chef's Notes
* **Sourcing:** Pork bones can be found at most Asian markets or by asking your local butcher.
* **Make-ahead:** The broth and tare can be made several days in advance.
* **Variations:** Add a spoonful of chili oil for a spicy kick.
* **Common pitfalls:** Don't boil the broth too vigorously, as it can make it cloudy instead of creamy. Skimming the scum is crucial for a clean-tasting broth.
