# Beef and Broccoli Stir-Fry

## ID: 156318

## Cultural Context & Origin
Beef and Broccoli is a classic Chinese-American stir-fry dish that has become a staple in North American Chinese restaurants. While its exact origins are debated, it is believed to have been developed by Chinese immigrants in the United States, adapting traditional Cantonese cooking techniques and ingredients to suit Western palates. The dish features tender, velveteen beef and crisp-tender broccoli florets in a savory and slightly sweet brown sauce.

## Ingredients

### Main
*   Beef flank steak or sirloin: 1 lb (450g), thinly sliced against the grain
*   Broccoli: 1 large head (about 1 lb/450g), cut into bite-sized florets

### Marinade
*   Light soy sauce: 2 tbsp (30ml)
*   Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry): 1 tbsp (15ml)
*   Cornstarch: 1 tbsp (10g)
*   Baking soda: 1/4 tsp

### Sauce
*   Oyster sauce: 3 tbsp (45ml)
*   Dark soy sauce: 1 tbsp (15ml)
*   Water or beef broth: 1/2 cup (120ml)
*   Sugar: 1 tsp (5g)
*   Cornstarch: 1 tsp (5g)
*   Sesame oil: 1 tsp (5ml)

### Stir-fry
*   Vegetable oil: 2 tbsp (30ml), divided
*   Garlic: 3 cloves, minced
*   Ginger: 1-inch piece, minced

## Instructions

1.  **Velvet the Beef:** In a medium bowl, combine the sliced beef with the marinade ingredients (light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, cornstarch, and baking soda). Mix well and set aside for at least 15 minutes.
2.  **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together all the sauce ingredients (oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, water or beef broth, sugar, cornstarch, and sesame oil). Set aside.
3.  **Blanch the Broccoli:** Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the broccoli florets and blanch for 1-2 minutes, until crisp-tender and bright green. Drain immediately and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.
4.  **Stir-fry the Beef:** Heat 1 tbsp of vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the marinated beef and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, until browned and just cooked through. Remove the beef from the wok and set aside.
5.  **Assemble the Stir-fry:** Add the remaining 1 tbsp of vegetable oil to the wok. Add the minced garlic and ginger and stir-fry for about 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the blanched broccoli and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes. Return the cooked beef to the wok. Give the sauce a quick stir and pour it into the wok. Stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and everything is well combined.
6.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with steamed rice.

## Equipment
*   Wok or large skillet
*   Cutting board and knife
*   Medium bowl for marinating
*   Small bowl for the sauce
*   Pot for blanching broccoli

## Notes
*   **Sourcing:** Flank steak is the traditional choice for this dish, but sirloin or other tender cuts of beef can also be used. Using both light and dark soy sauce is recommended for a balanced flavor and color.
*   **Substitutions:** If you don't have Shaoxing wine, you can substitute it with dry sherry or Japanese sake. For a gluten-free version, use tamari instead of soy sauce and a gluten-free oyster sauce.
*   **Allergen Flags:** Contains soy and gluten (from soy sauce and oyster sauce). May contain shellfish (from oyster sauce).
*   **Storage & Reheat:** Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat until warmed through.
*   **Sensory Cues:** The beef should be tender and juicy, and the broccoli should be crisp-tender. The sauce should be glossy and have a rich, savory flavor.
