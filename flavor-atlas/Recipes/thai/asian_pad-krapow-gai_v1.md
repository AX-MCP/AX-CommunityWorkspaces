# Pad Krapow Gai (Thai Basil Chicken)

## ID: 9b943a

## Cultural Context & Origin
Pad Krapow Gai, or Thai Basil Chicken, is a ubiquitous and beloved street food dish from Thailand. Known for its rapid preparation and intense aromatic flavors, it's a go-to for weeknight meals across the country. The dish is characterized by the pungent, peppery notes of holy basil (krapow), which is distinct from regular sweet basil. It embodies the essence of Thai stir-frying: quick, high-heat cooking that balances sweet, salty, spicy, and umami tastes.

## Ingredients

### Main
*   Ground Chicken (or pork/beef): 300g (10.6 oz)
*   Holy Basil (or Thai Basil): 1 large bunch (~60g/2 oz), leaves picked
*   Garlic: 5-6 cloves, minced (1 tbsp)
*   Thai Bird's Eye Chilies: 5-10, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
*   Green Beans (optional): 100g (3.5 oz), trimmed and sliced diagonally
*   Jasmine Rice: 1 cup (240ml) uncooked
*   Water for rice: 1.25 cups (300ml)
*   Eggs: 2-3 large, for frying
*   Vegetable Oil: 2 tbsp (30ml), divided

### Sauce
*   Fish Sauce: 1.5 tbsp (22.5ml)
*   Light Soy Sauce: 1 tbsp (15ml)
*   Oyster Sauce: 1 tbsp (15ml)
*   Sugar (palm or brown): 1 tsp (5g)
*   Dark Soy Sauce: 0.5 tsp (2.5ml), for color (optional)

## Instructions

1.  **Prepare Rice:** Rinse 1 cup of jasmine rice until water runs clear. Combine with 1.25 cups water in a rice cooker or heavy-bottomed pot. Cook according to manufacturer's instructions, or bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Let rest, covered, for 10 minutes after cooking. (Bacillus cereus risk: cool rice quickly and refrigerate within 1 hour; consume within 1-2 days).
2.  **Chili & Garlic Paste:** In a mortar and pestle (or small food processor), pound/pulse garlic and chilies until a coarse paste forms. Be cautious handling chilies; wear gloves if sensitive.
3.  **Stir-fry Chicken:** Heat 1 tbsp (15ml) vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add chili-garlic paste and stir-fry rapidly for 15-30 seconds until fragrant, being careful not to burn. Add ground chicken and break it up with your spatula. Stir-fry until cooked through and lightly browned (internal minimum temperature 74°C/165°F).
4.  **Add Vegetables & Sauce:** If using green beans, add them now and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until tender-crisp. Whisk together all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Pour sauce over the chicken and vegetables, tossing to coat evenly. Cook for 1-2 minutes until sauce slightly thickens.
5.  **Finish with Basil:** Remove wok from heat. Add holy basil leaves and toss vigorously until just wilted. This preserves their vibrant flavor and aroma. Avoid overcooking the basil.
6.  **Fry Eggs:** In a separate small non-stick pan, heat remaining 1 tbsp (15ml) vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Fry eggs sunny-side up until the whites are set and crispy at the edges, and the yolk is still runny. (Optional: cook to desired doneness).
7.  **Serve:** Ladle hot jasmine rice onto plates. Top with the Pad Krapow Gai and a fried egg. Serve immediately.

## Equipment
*   Wok or large skillet
*   Rice cooker or heavy pot with tight lid
*   Mortar & pestle or small food processor
*   Cutting board and knife
*   Small non-stick pan (for eggs)

## Notes
*   **Sourcing Holy Basil:** Authentic holy basil (`krapow`) can be hard to find outside of Asian markets. Thai basil (with purple stems and anise-like flavor) is a good substitute, though the flavor profile will be slightly different. Regular sweet basil is not recommended.
*   **Chiles:** Thai bird's eye chilies provide significant heat. Adjust the quantity to your preferred spice level. For less heat, remove seeds.
*   **Soy Sauce:** Light soy sauce provides salinity. Dark soy sauce is primarily for color, adding a slight sweetness. Ensure you use Asian brands for authentic flavor.
*   **Allergen Flags:** Contains Soy (soy sauces), Fish (fish sauce), Egg (if served with fried egg).
*   **Storage & Reheat:** Store leftover Pad Krapow Gai and rice separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat thoroughly until steaming hot. Avoid reheating rice more than once to minimize Bacillus cereus risk.
*   **Sensory Cues:** The dish should be intensely fragrant with basil and garlic. The chicken should be well-browned with some crispy bits from the high-heat stir-fry, and the sauce should cling to the ingredients. The fried egg provides a rich, runny yolk to mix into the spicy chicken and rice.
