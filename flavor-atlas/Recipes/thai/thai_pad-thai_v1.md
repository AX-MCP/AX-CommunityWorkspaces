## Cultural Context
Pad Thai is Thailand's most iconic street food, created in the 1930s-40s as part of a nationalistic campaign to promote Thai identity and reduce rice consumption. This stir-fried rice noodle dish balances the four pillars of Thai flavor—sweet, sour, salty, and spicy—in perfect harmony. While variations exist across regions, the central Thai version with tamarind-based sauce remains the gold standard found at street carts from Bangkok to Chiang Mai.

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 200 g (7 oz / about 4 nests) dried flat rice noodles (banh pho, 5mm width)
- 200 g (7 oz) medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 large eggs
- 100 g (3.5 oz / 1 cup packed) bean sprouts
- 85 g (3 oz / ½ cup) extra-firm tofu, cut into 1cm cubes
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 shallots, thinly sliced
- 30 g (1 oz / ¼ cup) garlic chives or scallions, cut into 5cm pieces
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil (divided)

### For the Pad Thai Sauce
- 60 ml (¼ cup / 2 fl oz) tamarind paste (seedless concentrate)
- 45 ml (3 tablespoons) fish sauce
- 45 g (3 tablespoons) palm sugar or light brown sugar
- 15 ml (1 tablespoon) rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon paprika (for color)
- ¼ teaspoon white pepper

### Garnishes & Condiments
- 40 g (1.5 oz / ⅓ cup) roasted unsalted peanuts, coarsely crushed
- 2 limes, cut into wedges
- 100 g (3.5 oz / 1 cup) fresh bean sprouts
- Dried Thai chili flakes (prik bon)
- Additional fish sauce and sugar for table seasoning

**Substitutions:**
- Tamarind paste → Equal parts lime juice + pinch of sugar (less authentic but workable)
- Palm sugar → Light brown sugar or coconut sugar
- Fish sauce → Soy sauce + dash of Worcestershire (for vegetarian version, though flavor differs)
- Garlic chives → Green onions/scallions work well
- Shrimp → Chicken breast strips, more tofu, or omit for vegetarian

## Equipment
- Large wok or 12-inch skillet (carbon steel preferred for high heat)
- Wire spider or slotted spoon
- Medium mixing bowl
- Fine-mesh strainer
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Instant-read thermometer
- Large serving platter

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 20 min)
1. **Soak the rice noodles:** Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with room-temperature water. Soak for 25-30 minutes until pliable but still firm (like al dente pasta). They should bend without breaking but not be mushy. Drain thoroughly in a colander and set aside. Do not oversoak or they'll become gummy when stir-fried.

2. **Prepare the sauce:** In a medium bowl, whisk together tamarind paste, fish sauce, palm sugar, rice vinegar, paprika, and white pepper until sugar dissolves completely. The sauce should taste intensely sweet-sour-salty. Set aside. This takes about 2 minutes.

3. **Prep ingredients (mise en place):** Pat shrimp dry with paper towels. Cut tofu into cubes and pat dry. Arrange garlic, shallots, chives, eggs (cracked into a small bowl), and garnishes within arm's reach of the stove. Pad Thai cooks very quickly once you start—everything must be ready.

### Cooking (Active time: 10 min)
4. **Fry the tofu:** Heat wok over medium-high heat until a drop of water evaporates immediately. Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl. Add tofu cubes in a single layer and fry 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove to a plate.

5. **Cook the shrimp:** Add 1 tablespoon oil to the wok. When shimmering, add shrimp in a single layer. Cook 1-2 minutes per side until pink and just cooked through (internal temperature 52-57°C / 125-135°F for slightly translucent center, 60°C / 140°F for fully opaque). Remove to the plate with tofu.

6. **Scramble the eggs:** Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the wok. Pour in beaten eggs and let set for 15-20 seconds without stirring. Using a spatula, scramble into large, soft curds. Push eggs to the side of the wok.

7. **Build the stir-fry:** Add garlic and shallots to the center of the wok. Stir-fry 15-20 seconds until fragrant but not browned. Add drained noodles and pour sauce over them. Using two spatulas or tongs, toss continuously for 2-3 minutes, lifting and folding to coat every strand. The noodles should soften completely and absorb most of the sauce, turning a reddish-amber color.

8. **Finish the dish:** Return shrimp and tofu to the wok. Add 1 cup bean sprouts and garlic chives. Toss everything together for 30-45 seconds until bean sprouts are slightly wilted but still crunchy and chives are just softened. Taste a noodle—it should be tender with a slight chew, not mushy.

### Assembly & Finishing
9. **Plate and garnish:** Transfer Pad Thai to a large serving platter. Scatter crushed peanuts over the top. Arrange lime wedges, fresh bean sprouts, and dried chili flakes around the edges.

10. **Serve immediately:** Pad Thai is best eaten hot, within 5 minutes of finishing. Provide fish sauce, sugar, chili flakes, and extra lime wedges at the table so diners can adjust seasoning to taste.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Minimum safe internal temperature:** Shrimp should reach 60°C / 140°F for food safety; eggs should be fully scrambled (71°C / 160°F)
- **Storage:** Best eaten immediately. Refrigerate leftovers in airtight container for up to 1 day. Noodles will soften considerably.
- **Freezing:** Not recommended—noodles become mushy and bean sprouts lose texture
- **Reheating:** Use a wok or large skillet over high heat with 1-2 teaspoons oil. Toss for 2-3 minutes until hot. Add splash of water if too dry. Microwave works but texture won't be as good.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve with traditional Thai condiments on the side (prik nam pla—fish sauce with sliced chilies, sugar, chili flakes, ground peanuts)
- Pairs well with Thai iced tea or light lager beer
- Traditional serving style: On a banana leaf or wrapped in paper for street-food authenticity
- Add a side of cucumber slices to cool the palate

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** Halves easily for 2 servings. Use an 8-10 inch skillet instead of a wok to avoid overcrowding. Cooking times remain the same.

**Double recipe (2×):** Cook in two separate batches rather than doubling in one wok. Overcrowding prevents proper stir-frying and creates steamed, gummy noodles instead of the desired slightly charred texture. Keep first batch warm in a 95°C / 200°F oven while cooking the second.

## Chef's Notes
- **Sourcing:** Look for 5mm flat rice stick noodles (often labeled "pad thai noodles" or "banh pho") at Asian grocery stores. Tamarind paste concentrate (seedless) is sold in jars or blocks—avoid tamarind sauce or concentrate meant for drinks. Palm sugar comes in solid disks or jars; grate or chop if solid.
- **Make-ahead:** Sauce can be made 2-3 days ahead and refrigerated. Soak noodles up to 4 hours ahead but toss with 1 teaspoon oil to prevent sticking. Prep all ingredients (chop, slice, measure) up to 1 day ahead and store in separate containers.
- **Variations:** Northern Thai versions add pickled radish (chai poh) for tang. Some cooks add dried shrimp for extra umami. Vegetarian version uses soy sauce instead of fish sauce and adds more vegetables (carrots, cabbage). Street vendors often add a pinch of MSG.
- **Common pitfalls:** Oversoftening noodles during soaking is the #1 mistake—they'll turn mushy when stir-fried. Cooking over too-low heat causes steaming rather than searing. Not having all ingredients ready leads to burnt garlic and uneven cooking. The sweet-sour-salty balance should be intense but harmonious—adjust at the end if needed.
- **Wok hei:** For restaurant-quality results, use the highest heat your stove can achieve and work quickly. A slight char on some noodles (wok hei or "breath of the wok") adds depth.
