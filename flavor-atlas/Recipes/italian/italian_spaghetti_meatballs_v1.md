# Spaghetti & Meatballs

## Cultural Context
While pasta with meat sauce exists in Italy (like Bolognese), the combination of spaghetti with large, distinct meatballs is a quintessentially Italian-American invention. Born from Italian immigrants in America adapting to the abundance of affordable meat, this dish has become a global symbol of comfort food, marrying the techniques of the old country with the resources of the new.

## Ingredients

### Meatballs
- 250 g (9 oz) Ground beef (80/20)
- 250 g (9 oz) Ground pork
- 50 g (0.5 cup) Breadcrumbs (panko or homemade)
- 60 ml (0.25 cup) Milk (whole)
- 1 Large egg
- 40 g (0.5 cup) Parmigiano Reggiano, grated
- 2 cloves Garlic, minced
- 15 g (0.25 cup) Fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tsp Salt
- 0.5 tsp Black pepper

### Sauce
- 800 g (28 oz) Canned San Marzano tomatoes (crushed or whole/hand-crushed)
- 1 Small yellow onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves Garlic, thinly sliced
- 30 ml (2 tbsp) Olive oil
- Fresh basil leaves (handful)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Pinch of Red pepper flakes (optional)

### Pasta & Assembly
- 450 g (1 lb) Spaghetti (bronze-die cut preferred)
- Salt for pasta water
- Extra Parmigiano Reggiano for serving

**Substitutions:**
- **Meat:** Use all beef or a mix of beef/veal/pork. Turkey can be used but requires careful seasoning to avoid dryness.
- **Breadcrumbs:** Soaked stale bread (panade) can replace breadcrumbs/milk for softer texture.

## Equipment
- Large pot (for pasta)
- Large skillet or Dutch oven (for sauce and meatballs)
- Mixing bowl
- Tongs

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 15 min)
1. **Prepare the Panade:** In a small bowl, mix breadcrumbs and milk. Let sit for 5 minutes until absorbed.
2. **Mix Meatballs:** In a large bowl, combine beef, pork, soaked breadcrumbs, egg, cheese, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix gently with hands just until combined—do not overwork.
3. **Shape:** Form into 12-16 golf-ball sized meatballs.

### Cooking (Active time: 20 min)
4. **Brown Meatballs:** Heat olive oil in the large skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs (in batches if needed) and brown on all sides, about 5-6 minutes. They don't need to be cooked through. Remove to a plate.
5. **Start Sauce:** In the same skillet (keep the fond!), lower heat to medium. Add onion and sauté until translucent (5 min). Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook 1 minute until fragrant.
6. **Simmer:** Pour in tomatoes. Scrape up browned bits from the bottom. Bring to a simmer. Return meatballs to the sauce. Cover and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, or until meatballs are cooked through (165°F/74°C internal). Stir occasionally.
7. **Cook Pasta:** Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until *al dente* (usually 1-2 minutes less than package directions). Reserve 1 cup of pasta water.

### Assembly & Finishing
8. **Combine:** Transfer cooked pasta directly into the skillet with the sauce and meatballs. Toss gently to coat, adding a splash of reserved pasta water if needed to gloss the sauce. Cook together for 1 minute.
9. **Garnish and serve:** Remove from heat. Stir in fresh basil. Serve immediately topped with extra grated Parmigiano Reggiano.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Minimum safe internal temperature:** 165°F (74°C) for ground meat blends.
- **Storage:** Refrigerate in airtight container for up to 3 days.
- **Freezing:** Cooked meatballs and sauce freeze well for up to 3 months. Freeze pasta separately or make fresh.
- **Reheating:** Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of water to loosen the sauce.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve with garlic bread or a crisp green salad with vinaigrette.
- Pairs well with a medium-bodied red wine like Chianti or Sangiovese.

## Chef's Notes
- **Texture:** For lighter meatballs, don't squeeze the meat mixture too hard when shaping.
- **Sauce:** If using whole tomatoes, crush them by hand for a rustic texture.
- **Common pitfalls:** Overcooking the pasta before adding to the sauce. Always finish the pasta *in* the sauce for better flavor absorption.
