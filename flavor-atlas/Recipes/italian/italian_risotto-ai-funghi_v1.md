## Cultural Context
Risotto ai Funghi, or mushroom risotto, is a classic Italian dish showcasing the creamy, comforting texture characteristic of risotto. Originating in Northern Italy, where rice cultivation is prevalent, risotto is a culinary technique that involves slowly adding broth to rice while stirring, allowing the grains to release their starch and create a rich, velvety consistency. This mushroom variation is particularly popular in autumn, when fresh wild mushrooms are abundant.

## Ingredients

### Main Components
- 300 g (10.6 oz / 1½ cups) Arborio rice - or Carnaroli rice
- 500 g (17.6 oz) fresh mixed mushrooms - such as cremini, shiitake, or oyster, cleaned and sliced
- 1.2 L (40.5 fl oz / 5 cups) hot vegetable broth - or chicken broth
- 100 g (3.5 oz / 1 cup) Parmesan cheese - freshly grated, plus more for serving
- 1 medium onion - finely chopped (about 150g)
- 2 cloves garlic - minced
- 120 ml (4 fl oz / ½ cup) dry white wine - such as Pinot Grigio
- 50 g (1.8 oz / ¼ cup) unsalted butter - divided
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### For Garnish
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley - finely chopped

**Substitutions:**
- Fresh mixed mushrooms → 30g (1 oz) dried porcini mushrooms (rehydrated in warm water, strained, and chopping, reserving the soaking liquid to add to the broth)

## Equipment
- Large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven
- Wooden spoon
- Fine-mesh strainer (if using dried mushrooms)
- Ladle

## Instructions

### Preparation (Active time: 15 min)
1.  **Prepare the mushrooms:** If using fresh mushrooms, gently wipe them clean with a damp cloth or mushroom brush. Slice them evenly. If using dried porcini, rehydrate them in warm water for 20 minutes, then strain, reserving the liquid. Coarsely chop the rehydrated porcini.
2.  **Dice the aromatics:** Finely chop the onion and mince the garlic.
3.  **Heat the broth:** Bring the vegetable broth to a simmer in a separate pot and keep it hot over low heat.

### Cooking (Active time: 25 min)
4.  **Sauté aromatics:** In the large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 1 tbsp olive oil and 25 g (1.8 oz) butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Do not let the garlic brown.
5.  **Cook the mushrooms:** Add the sliced fresh mushrooms (or rehydrated porcini) to the pot. Sauté until they release their liquid and start to brown, about 5-8 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
6.  **Toast the rice:** Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir constantly for 2 minutes, ensuring every grain is coated in the oil and butter. The edges of the rice grains should become translucent, but the center should remain opaque.
7.  **Deglaze with wine:** Pour in the white wine and stir continuously until it is completely absorbed by the rice, about 2-3 minutes. The alcohol will evaporate, leaving behind its flavor.
8.  **Add broth gradually:** Begin adding the hot broth, one ladleful at a time (about 250 ml / 1 cup). Stir continuously, allowing the rice to absorb each addition of liquid before adding the next. This process should take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto should be creamy and slightly soupy, and the rice grains should be al dente (tender with a slight bite in the center).

### Assembly & Finishing
9.  **Stir in butter and cheese:** Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the remaining 25 g (1.8 oz) butter and 100 g (3.5 oz) grated Parmesan cheese. This step, known as *mantecare*, creates the signature creamy texture.
10. **Adjust seasoning and serve:** Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. If the risotto is too thick, stir in a little more hot broth until it reaches your desired consistency.
11. **Garnish and serve:** Serve immediately in warm bowls, garnished with fresh chopped parsley and an extra sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.

## Food Safety & Storage
- **Minimum safe internal temperature:** Risotto is typically not measured for internal temperature as it's cooked until rice is tender. Ensure all ingredients, especially mushrooms, are thoroughly cooked.
- **Storage:** Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days. Risotto's texture changes upon cooling, becoming firmer.
- **Freezing:** Not recommended, as the texture of the rice can become mushy and the creaminess is lost.
- **Reheating:** Reheat gently on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of broth or water to restore creaminess. Do not microwave for best results.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve as a rich first course or a vegetarian main dish.
- Pairs well with a crisp green salad and a glass of dry white wine.

## Scaling Notes
**Half recipe (½×):** Halve all ingredients. Cooking time may be slightly reduced, but follow sensory cues for doneness.

**Double recipe (2×):** Double all ingredients. You may need a very large pot. Cooking time will increase significantly (up to 30-35 minutes for broth absorption) due to the larger volume of rice. Ensure the broth remains hot.

## Chef's Notes
-   **Sourcing:** Use high-quality Arborio or Carnaroli rice for the best creamy texture. Look for fresh, firm mushrooms. Good quality vegetable broth will enhance the flavor.
-   **Make-ahead:** While risotto is best served immediately, you can prepare the mushroom and onion base in advance. Reheat and add rice and broth when ready to cook.
-   **Variations:** Experiment with different types of mushrooms (chanterelles, morels), or add other vegetables like asparagus or peas. A touch of truffle oil or fresh truffle shavings can elevate the dish.
-   **Common pitfalls:**
    *   **Not stirring enough:** Continuous stirring is crucial for releasing starch and achieving creaminess.
    *   **Adding cold broth:** Cold broth will shock the rice and stop the cooking process, affecting the texture.
    *   **Overcooking the rice:** Risotto should be al dente, not mushy. Taste frequently during the last few minutes of cooking.
