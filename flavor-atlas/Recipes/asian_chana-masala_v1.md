## Cultural Context & Notes
Chana Masala is a popular vegetarian dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It's a staple in North Indian cuisine and is enjoyed across South Asia. This hearty and flavorful dish is often served as a main course or a side dish, particularly during festivals or as a comforting weeknight meal. The term "chana" refers to chickpeas, and "masala" to a blend of spices. Regional variations exist, with some versions being drier and others having a more gravy-like consistency.

## Equipment
- Large skillet or pot
- Cutting board
- Knife
- Measuring spoons and cups
- Can opener

## Sourcing Notes
- **Chickpeas:** Canned chickpeas are convenient, but you can also use dried chickpeas soaked overnight and boiled until tender.
- **Spices:** For the best flavor, use freshly ground spices if possible. Garam masala blends can vary in potency; adjust to your preference.
- **Chiles:** Cayenne pepper provides a moderate heat. For a milder dish, reduce the amount or omit. For more heat, consider adding a finely chopped green chili (like Serrano or Thai bird's eye) with the aromatics.
