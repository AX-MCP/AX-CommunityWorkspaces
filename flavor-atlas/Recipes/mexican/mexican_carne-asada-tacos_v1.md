# Carne Asada Tacos

*Alt text: Three authentic carne asada tacos on charred corn tortillas, topped with chopped cilantro, white onion, lime wedges, and sliced radishes on a rustic wooden board*

## Cultural Context

Carne asada tacos are a cornerstone of Mexican street food culture, particularly beloved in Northern Mexico and Baja California. The name literally translates to "grilled meat," but this simple description belies the art behind perfectly charred, citrus-marinated beef served on a warm corn tortilla.

What sets authentic carne asada apart is the interplay of a quick, acidic marinade that tenderizes the meat while preserving its beefy flavor, and the high-heat cooking method that creates a caramelized crust. Traditionally cooked over mesquite charcoal at street-side taquerías, the meat is sliced thin and served immediately with minimal but purposeful toppings: fresh cilantro, white onion, a squeeze of lime, and perhaps a spicy salsa.

This version honors those traditions while adapting to the home kitchen, using a cast iron skillet or grill pan to achieve the essential char. The key is high heat, thin slices, and not overcomplicating the flavors – letting the quality beef shine through the bright marinade.

## Ingredients

### For the Carne Asada
- 680g / 1.5 lbs flank steak or skirt steak (thin cut preferred)
- 60ml / ¼ cup fresh lime juice (about 2-3 limes)
- 60ml / ¼ cup fresh orange juice (about 1 orange)
- 45ml / 3 tbsp neutral oil (vegetable or avocado)
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced (keep seeds for extra heat)
- 15ml / 1 tbsp soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce
- 10g / 2 tsp ground cumin
- 5g / 1 tsp chili powder
- 5g / 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 2.5g / ½ tsp black pepper
- 5g / 1 tsp kosher salt

### For Assembly
- 12 corn tortillas (6-inch / 15cm)
- 60g / ½ cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped
- 80g / ½ cup white onion, finely diced
- 3-4 limes, cut into wedges
- 4-5 radishes, thinly sliced
- Salsa of choice (salsa verde, pico de gallo, or salsa roja)

### Substitutions
- **Steak**: Sirloin flap meat (carne asada cut), hanger steak, or thinly sliced ribeye
- **Citrus**: All lime juice works if no orange available (add pinch of sugar to balance)
- **Tortillas**: Flour tortillas for Tex-Mex style (or mix of both)
- **Toppings**: Add crumbled queso fresco, Mexican crema, grilled green onions, or pickled jalapeños

## Equipment

**Essential:**
- Large zip-top bag or shallow dish (for marinating)
- Cast iron skillet or grill pan
- Sharp knife and cutting board
- Tongs
- Small skillet or comal (for tortillas)

**Optional:**
- Outdoor grill (preferred for authentic char)
- Meat thermometer
- Kitchen scale for precise measurements

## Instructions

### Preparation (10 minutes)

1. **Prepare the marinade:** In a large zip-top bag or shallow dish, combine lime juice, orange juice, oil, minced garlic, jalapeño, soy sauce, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, and salt. Whisk or shake until well mixed. *The marinade should smell bright and citrusy with a savory undertone.*

2. **Prep the steak:** Pat the flank steak dry with paper towels. If the steak is thicker than ½ inch (1.25cm), use a meat mallet to gently pound it to even thickness. This ensures quick, even cooking. Score the meat lightly in a crosshatch pattern on both sides (shallow cuts, about ⅛ inch deep) to help the marinade penetrate.

3. **Marinate:** Add the steak to the marinade, turning to coat completely. Seal the bag or cover the dish. Let rest at room temperature for 10 minutes (or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator – bring to room temp for 15 minutes before cooking if refrigerated). *Don't marinate longer than 2 hours as the acid can start to "cook" the meat and change its texture.*

4. **Prep toppings:** While the meat marinates, dice the white onion, chop the cilantro, slice the radishes, and cut the limes into wedges. Arrange in small bowls for easy assembly.

### Cooking (15 minutes)

5. **Heat your cooking surface:** Place a cast iron skillet or grill pan over high heat. Let it preheat for 3-4 minutes until smoking hot. *A drop of water should sizzle and evaporate immediately.* If using an outdoor grill, preheat to 450-500°F (230-260°C).

6. **Sear the steak:** Remove the steak from the marinade, letting excess drip off (discard the marinade). Place the steak on the hot surface. *You should hear an immediate loud sizzle.* Cook without moving for 3-4 minutes until a dark crust forms. Flip and cook another 3-4 minutes for medium-rare (internal temp 130-135°F / 54-57°C). *The meat should feel slightly firm but still give when pressed with tongs.*

7. **Rest the meat:** Transfer the steak to a cutting board and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 5 minutes. *This allows juices to redistribute, keeping the meat moist when sliced.*

8. **Warm the tortillas:** While the steak rests, heat a dry skillet or comal over medium-high heat. Warm each tortilla for 20-30 seconds per side until pliable and slightly charred in spots. *They should puff slightly and develop a few dark spots.* Stack and wrap in a clean kitchen towel to keep warm.

### Assembly & Finishing (5 minutes)

9. **Slice the steak:** Using a sharp knife, slice the steak against the grain into thin strips (¼ inch / 6mm thick). *Look for the direction of the muscle fibers and cut perpendicular to them – this ensures tender bites.* Collect any juices from the cutting board and drizzle back over the meat.

10. **Assemble tacos:** Place 2-3 slices of carne asada on each warm tortilla. Top with a pinch of chopped white onion and cilantro. Serve immediately with lime wedges, sliced radishes, and salsa on the side.

## Food Safety & Storage

**Safe Cooking Temperatures:**
- Medium-rare: 130-135°F (54-57°C) – recommended for best texture and flavor
- Medium: 135-145°F (57-63°C)
- Never leave marinating meat at room temperature for more than 2 hours

**Storage:**
- **Cooked meat**: Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days
- **Marinated raw meat**: Refrigerate for up to 2 days before cooking
- **Reheating**: Reheat sliced meat in a hot skillet for 1-2 minutes (do not microwave as it will toughen)

**Leftover Ideas:**
Use leftover carne asada in quesadillas, burrito bowls, nachos, or breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs.

## Serving Suggestions

**Traditional Accompaniments:**
- Mexican rice (arroz rojo)
- Refried beans (frijoles refritos)
- Elote (Mexican street corn)
- Fresh guacamole and tortilla chips

**Beverage Pairings:**
- Ice-cold Mexican lager (Corona, Modelo, Pacifico)
- Fresh agua fresca (watermelon or lime)
- Margaritas (on the rocks with salt rim)

**Make it a Feast:**
Serve family-style with multiple salsas (verde, roja, and pico de gallo), pickled vegetables, and warm tortillas in a basket.

## Scaling Notes

**For 2 servings (6 tacos):**
- Steak: 340g / 12 oz
- Reduce marinade by half
- 6 tortillas
- Halve topping quantities

**For 8 servings (24 tacos):**
- Steak: 1.36kg / 3 lbs (cook in two batches for best sear)
- Double marinade ingredients
- 24 tortillas
- Double topping quantities
- *Note: When cooking multiple steaks, ensure pan stays hot between batches – add more oil if needed*

## Chef's Notes

**Sourcing & Selection:**
- Look for "carne asada" pre-sliced meat at Mexican markets for authentic thin cuts
- Skirt steak has more intense beefy flavor; flank is leaner and slightly more tender
- Outside skirt steak is preferred over inside skirt (more marbling)

**Make-Ahead Strategy:**
- Marinate the steak the night before (up to 24 hours)
- Prep all toppings and store separately in the fridge
- Cook the steak just before serving for best texture

**Variations:**
- **Chimichurri Style**: Replace cilantro/onion with fresh chimichurri sauce
- **Surf & Turf**: Add grilled shrimp alongside the beef
- **Breakfast Tacos**: Top with fried eggs and serve with black beans
- **Al Pastor Fusion**: Add grilled pineapple chunks for a sweet contrast

**Common Pitfalls:**
- **Overcrowding the pan**: Cook one steak at a time to maintain high heat
- **Cutting with the grain**: Always slice against the grain or meat will be chewy
- **Cold tortillas**: Warm tortillas are essential – cold ones crack and lack flavor
- **Over-marinating**: More than 4 hours and the meat gets mushy from the acid
- **Moving the meat too much**: Let it sear undisturbed to develop the crust

**Pro Tips:**
- For maximum char, pat the steak completely dry before searing
- Add a squeeze of fresh lime juice to the sliced meat just before serving
- If using a grill, leave steaks whole until after cooking for easier handling
- Save steak juice from the cutting board and mix with warm tortillas for extra flavor
