## Major Market Stories

### 1️⃣ **Federal Reserve Rate Cut Expectations**

Market participants are pricing in an **83% probability** of a 25 basis-point rate cut at the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

**Key Development:** New York Federal Reserve President John Williams signaled support for another quarter-point reduction in the federal funds rate, reinforcing market expectations and providing a bullish tailwind for equities.

However, inflation remains a "stubborn specter," with concerns about resurging price pressures even as the Fed moves toward additional easing. The Fed must balance supporting economic growth while managing persistent inflationary pressures.

### 2️⃣ **AI Sector Volatility and Magnificent Seven Dominance**

The "Magnificent Seven" mega-cap technology stocks—**Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla**—continued to drive the majority of S&P 500 gains in 2025, accounting for most of the benchmark's approximately 12% year-to-date performance.

**Market Dynamics:**
- AI-related stocks showed heightened volatility, with the sector experiencing both surges and sharp pullbacks
- Valuations in mega-cap AI stocks remain significantly elevated, leaving little margin for error if growth forecasts falter
- Friday's 2.7% Nasdaq rally was fueled by optimism surrounding AI hyperscalers and infrastructure developers
- The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) peaked at 27.8 on Thursday, November 21, and closed around 26.3—the highest level since April's tariff-related market selloff

**Mixed Signals:** While AI enthusiasm continues to drive tech valuations higher, concerns about sustainability and potential bubble conditions are growing among analysts.

### 3️⃣ **Tariff Impact and Trade Policy Concerns**

**Record Tariff Collections:** Tariff collections totaled **$33 billion** for the month, representing a **316% increase** from the prior year, as the Trump administration's trade policies continued to reshape global commerce.

The coming weeks will be critical as the December FOMC meeting approaches and year-end positioning accelerates. Investors should monitor:
1. Federal Reserve communications and December meeting outcomes

3. Tariff policy developments and economic impact
4. Inflation data releases
5. Volatility levels and market breadth indicators

**Overall Assessment:** Cautiously optimistic with heightened attention to risk management given elevated valuations and macro uncertainties.
