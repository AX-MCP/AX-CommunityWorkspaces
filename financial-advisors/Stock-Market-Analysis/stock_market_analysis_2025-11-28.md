## Conclusion

November 28, 2025, saw markets end the month on a positive note with five consecutive days of gains, but the broader November picture revealed challenges. The Nasdaq's seven-month winning streak ended, while the S&P 500 posted its first monthly decline in seven months.

Key themes emerged: Intel's dramatic rally on Apple speculation, retail strength on Black Friday, silver's historic performance, and growing certainty of a December Fed rate cut. The divergence between large-cap and small-cap performance suggests investors are positioning for a changing economic environment.

As we enter December, market participants will focus on the Fed's decision, holiday sales data, and year-end positioning. The combination of rate cut expectations and strong consumer spending projections provides a constructive backdrop, though recent tech weakness warrants monitoring.
