---

## Conclusion

Friday, December 6, 2025, saw U.S. markets take a breather ahead of the pivotal Federal Reserve meeting, with modest declines across major indices. The pullback was orderly and relatively shallow, reflecting investor caution rather than panic. Technology's outperformance demonstrates continued confidence in growth sectors, while rising Treasury yields signal market concerns about the longer-term inflation and rate outlook.

The week ahead will be critical, with the Fed's decision and accompanying commentary likely to set the tone for year-end trading. With the S&P 500 up 16% year-to-date and sitting less than 1% from record highs, markets have significant gains to protect while navigating an uncertain rate environment.

**Key Takeaway:** Markets remain resilient but are approaching a critical decision point. The Fed's messaging about 2026 policy will be just as important as the expected December rate cut. Investors should maintain balanced portfolios with exposure to both growth (technology) and value (financials) sectors while remaining mindful of elevated valuations.
