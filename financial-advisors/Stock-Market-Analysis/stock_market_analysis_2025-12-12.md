### Detailed Sector Insights

**Technology & Semiconductors**: The sharp selloff in these sectors reflected growing concerns about AI valuations and margin sustainability. The semiconductor index's 4.7% decline was broad-based, affecting both established players (Nvidia, AMD) and newer entrants (Astera Labs, Arteris).

**Financials**: Goldman Sachs led the sector with a 5% weekly gain, benefiting from the improved lending environment post-Fed rate cut and the rotation into value stocks. Banks and financial services companies are positioned to benefit from normalized interest rate spreads.

**Healthcare**: Companies like Johnson & Johnson, UnitedHealth, Zimmer Biomet, and Merck demonstrated resilience. The sector offers defensive characteristics while maintaining growth potential through pharmaceutical innovation and aging demographics.

**Energy**: The sector showed volatility, with intraday strength driven by AI data center demand for power, but closed mixed due to commodity price fluctuations. Long-term fundamentals remain supportive given energy needs of expanding data center infrastructure.

**Consumer Discretionary**: The cannabis rally within this sector was partially offset by weakness in other consumer names. Retail stocks like Lululemon showed strength, suggesting selective consumer spending resilience.
