## Conclusion

November 20, 2025, exemplified the market's current fragile state—where even exceptional corporate earnings (NVIDIA) couldn't overcome broader macroeconomic concerns. The collapse in December rate cut expectations, combined with stretched tech valuations and data uncertainty, created a perfect storm for selling pressure.

Investors should prepare for continued volatility as the Fed meeting approaches. The disconnect between strong corporate fundamentals and declining stock prices may present opportunities for long-term investors, but near-term turbulence appears likely. Diversification across sectors and geographies, particularly given strong international market performance, may be prudent as we head into year-end.
