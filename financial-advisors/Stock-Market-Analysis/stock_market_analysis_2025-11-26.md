## Major Market Stories & Themes

### 1. Market Volatility Spike Subsiding

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's "fear gauge," had peaked at 27.8 earlier in November—its highest level since the April 2025 tariff crisis. The VIX had risen 50% during November alone, marking only the 11th month in history with such a dramatic jump. However, by November 26, volatility began to subside as markets stabilized heading into the holiday period.

**Context**: The earlier volatility spike was triggered by concerns about tech valuations and tariff uncertainties, but improving sentiment around Federal Reserve policy has helped calm markets.

### 2. Federal Reserve Policy Outlook Improving

**Key Development**: New York Fed President John Williams made dovish comments that significantly shifted market expectations for monetary policy.

- **Before Williams' Comments**: Money markets priced in just 40% chance of a December rate cut
- **After Williams' Comments**: Markets now see 73% probability of a December reduction
- **Fed Chair Powell's Position**: Suggested a pause in rate cuts, but market participants are betting on continued easing

**Market Impact**: The improving odds for a December rate cut have provided a tailwind for equities, particularly growth stocks sensitive to interest rate movements.

### 3. Tech Valuations Under Scrutiny

Despite strong performance, Wall Street is growing increasingly concerned about stock valuations, particularly among U.S. tech giants:

- Several major tech firms are trading at price-to-earnings multiples last seen during the early 2000s dotcom bubble
- Even Nvidia's blockbuster earnings couldn't fully calm nerves about whether AI-fueled gains have outpaced fundamentals
- Investors are questioning whether current valuations can be sustained

**Counterpoint**: Corporate earnings continue to impress Wall Street, and investors remain committed to betting big on AI as a transformative technology.

### 4. Remarkable Market Recovery from April Tariff Crisis

**Historical Context**: After reaching its lowest point of 2025 on April 7 during the Trump tariff announcement selloff, the S&P 500 has surged nearly 36% and remains near all-time highs as of late November.

- The April selloff was triggered by Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs that caused a global market selloff
- The Dow tumbled more than 1,600 points in a single day following the major tariff announcement
- Recovery has been remarkably swift and sustained, demonstrating market resilience

### 5. AI Trade Remains Central Theme

The artificial intelligence trade continues to dominate market narrative:
- Alphabet's 24% surge in November reflects sustained AI optimism
- Despite valuation concerns, investors continue to pile into AI-exposed stocks
- Corporate earnings show real revenue growth from AI initiatives, validating some of the bullish sentiment

### 6. Pre-Thanksgiving Trading Dynamics

The November 26 trading session exhibited typical pre-holiday characteristics:
- Positive sentiment as investors position ahead of the holiday
- Best week since late June across major indices
- Broad-based participation across most sectors
- Lower volume expected as traders prepare for Thanksgiving break

## Conclusion

November 26, 2025 represented another positive session for U.S. equities, with the market extending its winning streak to four consecutive days ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The S&P 500's reclamation of its 50-day moving average, combined with improving Federal Reserve rate cut expectations, provided a strong technical and fundamental backdrop for the rally.

The market showed impressive resilience given the volatility experienced earlier in November, when the VIX spiked to its highest level since the April tariff crisis. Technology stocks, particularly AI-related names like Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft, continued to lead the market higher despite growing concerns about stretched valuations.

With the S&P 500 up more than 3% for the week and the Nasdaq rising more than 4%, major indices are on track for their best weekly performance since late June. The broad-based nature of the rally, with 9 out of 11 sectors posting gains, suggests healthy market participation rather than narrow leadership.

However, investors should remain mindful of valuation concerns, particularly in the technology sector where some stocks are trading at multiples not seen since the early 2000s dotcom bubble. The sustainability of the AI-driven rally will likely depend on continued strong earnings growth and successful monetization of AI investments.

As the market heads into the holiday season and the final weeks of 2025, the combination of supportive Federal Reserve policy, strong corporate earnings, and continued AI enthusiasm appears to be outweighing concerns about elevated valuations and earlier volatility spikes.
