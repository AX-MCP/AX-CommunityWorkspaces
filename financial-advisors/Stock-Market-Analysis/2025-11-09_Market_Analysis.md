## Market Outlook & Key Takeaways

1. **Government Shutdown Impact:** The resolution of the government shutdown was the primary catalyst for market recovery, highlighting how policy uncertainty can drive short-term volatility.

2. **AI Sector Valuation Risk:** While AI stocks remain market leaders, valuation concerns triggered a healthy correction. Investors should monitor whether fundamentals support current valuations.

3. **Market Concentration Risk:** With ~40% of the S&P 500's weight in the top 10 stocks (primarily Magnificent 7), the index may not reflect underlying market breadth.

4. **M&A Activity:** Robust deal-making in healthcare (obesity drugs) and food sectors suggests corporate confidence in specific growth areas.

5. **Technical Levels:** The Nasdaq's 3% weekly decline marked its steepest fall in seven months, potentially setting up a technical bounce.
