## Major Stories & Market Drivers

### 1. **Nvidia Earnings: The AI Trade Lives On**

Nvidia's Q3 2025 earnings served as the "keystone event" of the week, directly addressing growing concerns about an AI bubble. The chipmaker's results demonstrated that AI infrastructure demand remains robust, with CEO Jensen Huang emphasizing that cloud GPUs are "sold out" and Blackwell chip demand is exceptional.

**Market Significance:**
- Restored confidence in the AI trade driving the bull market
- Lifted sentiment across the entire technology sector
- Projected trillions in AI infrastructure spending by decade's end
- Strong forecast indicates sustained momentum into 2026

### 2. **Retail Sector Divergence: A Tale of Two Tiers**

November 19 revealed a clear split in the retail sector:

**Winners:** Home improvement retailers like Lowe's benefiting from:
- Professional contractor focus
- Strong online sales execution
- Home services growth
- Housing market resilience

**Losers:** General merchandise retailers like Target facing:
- Weakening discretionary spending
- Declining foot traffic
- Reduced transaction sizes
- Consumer budget pressures

This divergence highlights selective consumer spending, with essential home improvements outperforming discretionary purchases.

### 3. **Federal Reserve Uncertainty**

The Fed released minutes from its October meeting, revealing division among officials:

**Key Takeaways:**

- Governor Christopher Waller supported December cut as "risk management"

**Market Impact:** This uncertainty continues to influence market volatility and investor sentiment around interest rate-sensitive sectors.

### 4. **Week-Long Context: Recovery from Sell-Off**

November 19's rally came after a difficult period for markets:

**Previous Week Performance:**
- S&P 500: -2.62%
