## Conclusion

December 7, 2025 (reflecting Friday December 6 close and Monday December 8 pre-market) showed a market in cautiously optimistic mode heading into the Federal Reserve's final rate decision of the year. The Nasdaq's tech-leadership continues with AI and semiconductor stories dominating headlines, while major M&A activity (IBM-Confluent) signals corporate confidence. However, with the S&P 500 already up 17% year-to-date and trading near record highs, investors should be prepared for potential profit-taking after the expected Fed rate cut. The divergence between tech strength and industrial weakness (Dow underperformance) suggests selective opportunities rather than broad-based buying.

**Key Takeaway**: Markets are well-positioned heading into the Fed meeting, but the "buy the rumor, sell the news" dynamic could emerge if the 90% priced-in rate cut materializes without additional dovish surprises.
