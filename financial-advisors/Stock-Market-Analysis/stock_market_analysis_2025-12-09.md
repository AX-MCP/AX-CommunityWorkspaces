## Conclusion

December 9, 2025 represented a holding pattern for U.S. equity markets as investors positioned ahead of the Federal Reserve's pivotal interest rate decision. The mixed performance across indices—with small caps surging to records while large caps struggled—reflects divergent expectations about policy and economic trajectories.

The JPMorgan warning about consumer fragility and rising costs introduced a cautionary note, tempering enthusiasm from positive developments like Nvidia's China export approval and the Russell 2000's all-time high. With the Fed decision less than 24 hours away, market participants are focused on not just the expected rate cut, but the forward guidance that will shape 2026 positioning.

The small-cap strength suggests underlying optimism about domestic economic conditions and potential policy benefits from the incoming administration, while large-cap caution reflects concerns about elevated valuations and execution risks in translating AI investments into profits.
