## Sentiment Trend Analysis

| Date | Score | Status | Key Driver |
|------|-------|--------|------------|
| Nov 22 | 48 | Fear | Crypto crash, tech weakness |
| Nov 23 | 52 | Neutral (Fear) | Fed optimism |
| Nov 24 | 54 | Neutral (Fear) | Continued recovery |
| Nov 25 | 58 | Neutral | Strong rally |
| Nov 26 | 62 | Neutral (Greed) | Momentum building |
| Nov 27 | 56 | Neutral | Thanksgiving consolidation |
| Nov 29 | **68** | **Neutral (Greed)** | **Record highs, strong week** ✅ |

**7-Day Change:** +20 points (significant improvement)
**Trend:** Strongly improving, transitioning from Fear to Greed

## Bottom Line 🎯

The market has experienced a remarkable transformation over the past week, moving decisively from "Fear" territory into "Neutral-Leaning Greed." The **68/100 score** reflects:

✅ **Strong Fundamental Support:** 83% earnings beat rate, record index levels, $500B AI investment pipeline
✅ **Fed Support:** 80-85% probability of December rate cut providing monetary tailwind
✅ **Momentum:** Five-day winning streak, best weekly performance since June
✅ **Broad Participation:** Small caps (Russell 2000) outperforming, sector rotation healthy

⚠️ **Caution Warranted:** Nasdaq's seven-month streak break, elevated inflation globally, geopolitical risks, and concentration in mega-cap tech suggest maintaining defensive positioning alongside growth exposure.

**Investment Recommendation:** Participate in the rally through quality equities while maintaining defensive hedges (precious metals, utilities, healthcare). The December FOMC meeting will be critical in determining whether sentiment can push toward "Greed" (70+) or if we consolidate at current levels.

**Risk Management:** Maintain 5% cash for opportunities, reduce cryptocurrency exposure to ≤2%, and rebalance away from over-concentrated tech positions. The environment favors selective stock picking over broad index exposure.
