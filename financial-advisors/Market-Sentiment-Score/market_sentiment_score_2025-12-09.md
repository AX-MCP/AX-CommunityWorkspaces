   - Implications for enterprise software sector

## Conclusion

The market is in a **GREED** state (Score: 62/100), characterized by strong YTD performance, low volatility, high earnings beat rates, and elevated optimism around Fed rate cuts. However, this is **not extreme greed** - several factors prevent complacency:

1. Rising long-term interest rates (10-year at 4.17%)
2. Global monetary policy divergence (BOJ tightening vs PBOC easing)
3. Elevated valuations (Forward P/E 22.4)
4. Geopolitical tensions (tariffs at century highs)
5. Sector concentration (Tech only positive sector)

**Investment Strategy:** Maintain constructive positioning but add defensive measures. The market can sustain moderate greed if the Fed delivers as expected and Broadcom validates AI infrastructure demand. However, any disappointment could quickly shift sentiment.

**Critical Week Ahead:** December 9-13 is pivotal with Fed decision, Adobe earnings, and Broadcom results. These events will determine if greed extends into year-end or if profit-taking begins.

**2026 Outlook:** Base case remains constructive (S&P 500 6,700-7,200 year-end), but investors should prepare for increased volatility as multiple central banks diverge on policy and geopolitical risks persist.
