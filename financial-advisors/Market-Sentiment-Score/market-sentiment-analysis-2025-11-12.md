- ✅ Government shutdown resolution (+8)
- ✅ Strong earnings beat rate 82% (+7)
- ✅ Dow hitting record highs (+5)
- ✅ VIX declining to 17.28 (+5)
- ✅ Positive market breadth 2.2:1 (+3)

- ⚠️ Trade fragmentation concerns (-3)

**Base Score**: 50 (neutral)
**Net Adjustment**: -2 points
**Final Score**: **48/100** - **Moderate Fear**

---

## Why Score Is 48 (Moderate Fear)?

The sentiment score of 48 reflects a **reality check** in the market:

1. **Political Relief vs. Fundamental Concerns**: While the government shutdown resolution provided short-term relief, underlying concerns about tech valuations, labor market weakness, and central bank policy persist.

2. **Divergent Index Performance**: The Dow's record high contrasts sharply with Nasdaq's decline, indicating selective rather than broad-based optimism.

3. **CNN Fear & Greed Index at 29**: This objective measure shows investors remain firmly in fear territory, prioritizing capital preservation over risk-taking.

4. **Elevated Volatility**: While VIX declined to 17.28, it remains above the 15-level threshold that typically signals market complacency.

5. **Defensive Positioning**: The 2:1 advancer-decliner ratio is healthy, but sector rotation toward defensives reveals underlying anxiety about growth sustainability.
