## Historical Context and Outlook

### Historical Precedent

### Current vs. Historical Fear Periods
- **2008 Financial Crisis:** Extended extreme fear (months)
- **2020 COVID Crash:** Brief extreme fear (weeks)
- **Current Environment:** Persistent but potentially shorter duration given strong earnings fundamentals

### Key Differences
- Corporate earnings remain resilient (82% Q3 beat rate)
- Balance sheets generally strong
- No systemic financial crisis evident
- Fear driven by policy uncertainty rather than fundamental deterioration
