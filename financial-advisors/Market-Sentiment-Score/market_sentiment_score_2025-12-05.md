## Market Outlook

**Short-Term (1-2 weeks):** CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC
- FOMC meeting on Dec 9-10 is critical catalyst

**Medium-Term (1-3 months):** NEUTRAL TO POSITIVE
- Fed rate cutting cycle supportive of equities
- Corporate earnings growth trajectory remains strong
- Central bank divergence creates cross-currents
- Tariff policies remain wildcard for Q1 2026

**Long-Term (6+ months):** CONSTRUCTIVE
- AI infrastructure buildout has multi-year runway

## Conclusion

The market is in **GREED** territory with a sentiment score of **63/100**, driven by exceptional corporate earnings, imminent Fed rate cuts, and strong AI infrastructure momentum. However, this optimism is not excessive—defensive positioning in gold, geopolitical uncertainties, and the upcoming FOMC meeting provide important counterweights.

**Key Takeaway:** This is a market driven by fundamentals (earnings strength, Fed support) rather than irrational exuberance. Investors should maintain exposure to risk assets while being selective and maintaining hedges through gold and defensive sectors.

**Critical Date:** December 9-10 FOMC meeting will be the key catalyst that could either propel the market toward extreme greed or trigger a healthy pullback toward neutral sentiment.
