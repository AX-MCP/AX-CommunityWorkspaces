3. **Strong upcoming earnings calendar** - 850+ companies reporting with high corporate activity
4. **Technology sector leadership** - NVIDIA, Tesla leading market recovery

## Trend Analysis

### Score Evolution
- **Previous (2 hours ago):** 62/100
- **Current:** 64/100
- **Change:** +2 points

### Momentum Assessment
The modest 2-point improvement reflects markets digesting the substantial positive developments (shutdown resolution, trade de-escalation) while acknowledging persistent structural concerns. The market is **finding its footing** but not yet confident enough to push meaningfully above the 65 threshold into neutral territory.

Key observations:
1. **Professional investors remain defensive** - 60% equity allocation with significant cash buffers
2. **Corporate confidence strong** - High earnings participation and stock split activity
3. **Geopolitical risks moderating** - But not eliminated
4. **Volatility elevated but controlled** - VIX in 20s, not 30s

## Investment Strategy Context

- **Conservative Portfolios:** 50% Equities, 35% Fixed Income, 10% Alternatives, 5% Cash

- **Growth Portfolios:** 70% Equities, 15% Fixed Income, 10% Alternatives, 5% Cash
