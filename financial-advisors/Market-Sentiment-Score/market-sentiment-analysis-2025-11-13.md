### Score: 28/100 (Extreme Fear)

The market sentiment has deteriorated significantly from yesterday's moderate fear level (48/100) to today's extreme fear reading of **28/100**. This 20-point decline reflects a sharp risk-off rotation triggered by multiple converging headwinds.

   - Markets repricing Fed policy expectations
   - Higher-for-longer rate narrative returning

5. **Government Shutdown Aftermath**
   - Longest government shutdown in US history just ended
   - Economic impact concerns weighing on sentiment
   - Uncertainty about future fiscal policy

6. **Tech Valuation Concerns**
   - AI trade under pressure (Nasdaq -2.5%)
   - Rotation away from high-multiple tech stocks

## Why 28 (Extreme Fear)?

The 20-point deterioration from yesterday's 48 (Moderate Fear) reflects:

1. **Abrupt Sentiment Shift:** Markets transitioned from record highs (Monday/Tuesday) to broad selling in 48 hours
2. **Volatility Breakout:** VIX +17% surge signals fear spike
3. **Tech Rotation Accelerates:** Nasdaq underperformance (-2.5%) shows AI/tech concerns
4. **Fed Policy Repricing:** 96% → 47% rate cut odds = major hawkish adjustment
5. **Post-Shutdown Uncertainty:** Economic impact concerns from longest shutdown ever
6. **Earnings Disappointments:** Disney -7% adding to negative sentiment

**The combination of technical breakdown, Fed policy repricing, and sector-specific weakness has created a classic "extreme fear" environment.**

## Comparison to Previous Market Sentiment Scores

| Date | Score | Category | Key Driver |
|------|-------|----------|------------|

5. **Maintain discipline:** Avoid panic selling; use weakness to rebalance

### Investment Stance:
**CAUTIOUS BUT OPPORTUNISTIC** - Extreme fear environments historically mark tactical entry points, but confirmation from Nvidia earnings and Fed policy clarity is needed before aggressive deployment of capital.
