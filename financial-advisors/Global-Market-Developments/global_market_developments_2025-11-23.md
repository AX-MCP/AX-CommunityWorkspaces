## European Markets

### Overall Performance

The pan-European [STOXX 600](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/11/24/european-markets-on-novpoint24-stoxx-600-ftse-dax-cac-.html) opened the week on a positive note, up 0.1% by mid-morning trading (10:40 GMT), with most major bourses and sectors in positive territory. The modest gains reflected renewed optimism about potential Federal Reserve rate cuts rather than ECB-specific policy changes.

### Sector Highlights

**Pharmaceuticals (Leading Gains):**
- **Bayer AG** surged 9.4%, leading market gainers after reporting positive efficacy data from Phase III studies of its blood thinner Asundexian
- Strong pharmaceutical sector performance offset broader market concerns

**Defense Stocks (Notable Declines):**
- European defense stocks retreated amid ongoing U.S.-Ukraine peace negotiations
- **Rheinmetall** declined 4.5%
- Broader defense sector faced selling pressure as peace deal speculation intensified

### European Central Bank (ECB) Policy Stance

The ECB maintains its key interest rate at **2.0%**, down from its 2023 peak of 4.0%. While no specific policy announcement occurred on November 23, the current stance reflects:

- **Current Rate:** 2.0% (held steady through recent meetings)
- **Peak Rate:** 4.0% (reached in 2023)
- **Policy Direction:** Data-dependent approach with inflation near the 2% medium-term target
- **Market Expectations:** Wide consensus for rates to remain at current levels

The ECB's [monetary policy stance](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-2025-dialling-back-time) continues to balance inflation control with economic growth support, maintaining a cautious approach as the eurozone economy shows mixed signals.

## Asian Markets

### Market Performance Overview

Asian markets displayed divergent performance on and around November 23, reflecting regional economic dynamics and monetary policy expectations:

**Japan:**
- **Nikkei 225:** Declined 2.4% to close at 48,625.88 (Friday, November 21)

This marks a historic shift from the ultra-loose monetary policy maintained for over a decade.

### People's Bank of China (PBOC) Policy Outlook

**Current Policy Direction:**
- The PBOC plans to cut interest rates in 2025 as part of a historic shift toward more orthodox monetary policy
- Policy focus: Prioritizing "the role of interest rate adjustments"
- Market Impact: Anticipation of further stimulus measures supported demand for Hong Kong-listed stocks

**Economic Context:**

## Conclusion

November 23, 2025 represented a day of cautious positioning in global markets as investors balanced multiple crosscurrents. European markets found modest support from pharmaceutical innovation and Fed rate cut hopes, while defense stocks declined on peace speculation. Asian markets reflected regional monetary policy dynamics, with Japan facing normalization pressures and China anticipating further stimulus.

Investors navigating this environment must remain nimble, focusing on:

5. Long-term structural trends beyond cyclical noise

The coming weeks will be critical as central banks provide updated guidance, geopolitical negotiations progress, and year-end economic data clarifies the trajectory for 2026.
