## European Markets & ECB Policy

**Key Developments:**

- **ECB Policy Stance: ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos declared that the bank's current key interest rate level is appropriate, barring changes in the economic situation. The ECB maintains rates at the right level unless economic conditions deviate.**
- **Euro Strength: The euro extended gains toward $1.16, hovering near its strongest point since late October, as investors anticipate a busy week of central bank remarks.**
- **EUR/GBP Dynamics: Trading around 0.8790, the EUR/GBP pair remains subdued due to ECB and Bank of England policy differences.**
- **Green Finance Initiative: Euro zone banks are offering loans on more favorable terms to companies with better climate performance, potentially applying interest rate premia to those falling behind on climate goals.**

## Asian Markets - Bank of Japan (BOJ)

**Policy Developments:**
