## European Markets: Sustained Momentum

### Market Performance

The [STOXX 600](https://www.investing.com/indices/stoxx-600) closed Friday at **574.81**, after opening at 578.74 and trading in a range of 569.51-578.74. The benchmark has risen **14% in 2025**, supported by Germany's fiscal spending plans and ECB interest rate cuts.

On [December 4, equity markets finished higher](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/market-news-insights/stock-market-news/daily-market-recap), with industrial and technology stocks leading gains. [Eurozone retail sales for October rose 1.5%](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/market-news-insights/stock-market-news/daily-market-recap), providing additional support to the growth narrative.

### Individual Stock Highlights

- **Stellantis (Jeep owner)**: Shares advanced [7.7% after UBS upgraded to Buy](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/market-news-insights/stock-market-news/daily-market-recap)

### ECB Policy Stance

The ECB is maintaining a **cautious, data-dependent approach** to monetary policy:

**Current Rates**: The ECB kept key interest rates unchanged at its October meeting, following four rate cuts since June totaling **100 basis points**. As of January 2025, the [ECB lowered rates by 25 basis points](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250115~4f46a22389.en.html) in December.

**Inflation Outlook**: Inflation is expected to stay around the **2% target** in the coming months, with [wage growth expected to slow](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/press_conference/monetary-policy-statement/2025/html/ecb.is251030~4f74dde15e.en.html) over the remainder of the year and first half of 2026.

**Forward Guidance**: The [next Eurosystem staff projections](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/press_conference/monetary-policy-statement/2025/html/ecb.is251030~4f74dde15e.en.html) will be published on December 18, providing updated outlook for growth and inflation. The ECB continues its meeting-by-meeting approach, with risks remaining two-sided amid higher-than-usual uncertainty from volatile global trade policies.

### Analyst Outlook

[Citigroup set its 2026 year-end target](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/citigroup-sets-2026end-stoxx-600-target-at-640-on-fiscal-tailwinds-4392574) for the STOXX 600 at **640**, implying a 10.5% upside from Thursday's close, citing fiscal and cyclical tailwinds.

## Asian Markets: BOJ Rate Hike Speculation Dominates

### Market Performance

Asian markets showed mixed performance in the week, with Japan's equity indices diverging:

- **Nikkei 225**: [Gained more than 1%](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/market-news-insights/stock-market-news/daily-market-recap) overnight into Friday
- **Weekly Performance**: The [Nikkei 225 gained 0.47%](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/market-news-insights/stock-market-news/daily-market-recap) while the broader TOPIX Index fell 0.47%, facing pressure from rising global bond yields

China's markets showed varied performance amid continued economic headwinds.

### Bank of Japan (BOJ): December Rate Hike Likely

The BOJ is signaling its strongest intent yet for a December rate hike:

**Rate Hike Probability**: Traders see about a [76% chance of a rate hike](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-01/boj-s-ueda-sends-clear-hint-at-chance-of-december-rate-hike) when the central bank makes its decision on **December 19, 2025**.

**Governor Ueda's Signals**: On December 1, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda [sent the clearest hint yet](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/12/01/economy/boj-ueda-december-rate-hike-hint/) that the board might increase interest rates soon, stating the bank "will consider the pros and cons of raising the policy interest rate and make decisions as appropriate."

**Government Support**: [Key members of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's government](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/key-japan-officials-would-go-along-with-a-boj-december-rate-hike) wouldn't try to stop the BOJ if it decides to raise rates in December, making a move more likely.

**Expected Action**: Officials see a high likelihood of increasing the benchmark rate by **0.25 percentage points to 0.75%** at the December 18-19 meeting. This would push the policy rate in Japan to its **highest level since 1995**.

**Neutral Rate Discussion**: Ueda noted the BOJ [can only gauge the neutral rate within a wide range](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/boj-can-only-gauge-neutral-rate-within-wide-range-ueda-says), highlighting the uncertainty around optimal policy settings.

### People's Bank of China (PBOC): Historic Easing Continues

The PBOC is maintaining its historically accommodative stance:

**Policy Shift**: In December 2024, the PBOC shifted to a ["moderately loose" monetary policy](https://www.cepweb.org/monetary-policy-reloaded-towards-a-new-growth-path-in-china/) for 2025, dropping the "prudent" label for the first time since 2011.

**2025 Policy Actions**:
- [7-day reverse repurchase rate lowered from 1.5% to 1.4%](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688229/3688353/3688356/5624504/5846668/index.html)
- [Required reserve ratio lowered by 0.5 percentage points in May](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688229/3688353/3688356/5624504/5846668/index.html), releasing approximately RMB 1 trillion in liquidity
- Further RRR relaxation freed up an additional CNY 1 trillion in liquidity

**Economic Performance**:
- **Q1 2025**: [GDP grew 5.4% year-on-year](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688229/3688353/3688356/5624504/5742611/index.html)
- **Q2 2025**: Economy [expanded by 5.2% year-on-year](https://merics.org/en/tracker/solid-gdp-growth-q2-masks-chinas-challenges), down from 5.4% in Q1
- **H1 2025**: GDP expanded by 5.2%, above the government's annual growth target of around 5%

**Challenges**:
- [Outstanding loan growth fell to record low](https://merics.org/en/tracker/chinas-gdp-expands-q4-new-growth-drivers-are-needed-2025) of 7.6% in December year-on-year
- Consumer price inflation still hovering below 1%
- Producer prices continuing slow climb out of deflationary territory

## U.S. Markets: Four-Day Win Streak

### Market Performance - Friday, December 5, 2025

U.S. markets [closed higher for the fourth consecutive day](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-sp-500-nasdaq-dow-rise-as-fed-favored-pce-inflation-data-looms-234850919.html):

- Nasdaq: +~1%
- Dow: +~0.5%

*Note: December 6, 2025 was a Saturday, so U.S. markets were closed for the weekend.*

### Federal Reserve: Uncertain December Decision

The [December 9-10 FOMC meeting](https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/learning-and-insights/article/december-2025-federal-reserve-meeting-expectations) presents significant uncertainty:

**October Action**: The Fed [cut the target range by 0.25 percentage points to 3.75%-4.00%](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm) (approved 10-2).

**Market Expectations - Highly Divided**:
- [22% probability of a rate cut](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-december-2025-rate-cut-probability-fomc-meeting-economy/), down from 97% likelihood in mid-October (per FactSet economists)
- [72% chance of another 0.25% cut](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/fed-interest-rate-predictions-for-the-december-2025-policy-meeting/) according to some market indicators
- [Over 85% of bets riding on a quarter-point reduction](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-sp-500-nasdaq-dow-rise-as-fed-favored-pce-inflation-data-looms-234850919.html) at next week's meeting

**Fed Officials' Stance**:
- Chairman Powell noted a December rate cut is ["far from" certain](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/fed-rate-decision-october-2025.html)
- FOMC participants expressed [strongly differing views](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20251029.htm) about the appropriate December decision
- Most judge further downward adjustments would likely be appropriate over time, though several did not view another 25bp reduction as likely at the December meeting

**Economic Backdrop**: Mixed signals with inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target while the labor market shows signs of cooling.

## Cryptocurrency Markets: Bitcoin Recovery

### Current Price Action

As of December 6, 2025 (9:36 PM EST), **Bitcoin traded at $89,485.78** with 24-hour trading volume of $10.63B.

### Recent Volatility and Recovery

**Recent Decline**: Six weeks after its [$126,000 high in early October](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/bitcoin-down-nearly-30percent-from-record-high-history-shows-thats-normal.html), Bitcoin plunged 35% to a low of $82,000.

**Recovery Rally**: After weeks of decline, [Bitcoin jumped around 11% in two days](https://fortune.com/2025/12/03/bitcoin-bounces-back-more-than-10-after-brutal-week/), climbing to just under $93,000.

**Current Status**: Bitcoin now trades [about 32% below the power law model](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/05/how-much-longer-until-we-consider-the-bitcoin-power-law-model-invalid), with the model value near $118,000.

### Key Catalysts

**Positive Development**: [Vanguard's decision to let customers buy and sell crypto ETFs](https://fortune.com/2025/12/03/bitcoin-bounces-back-more-than-10-after-brutal-week/) represents a major turnaround, potentially opening crypto access to its 50 million brokerage customers.

**Historical Context**: Data shows [Bitcoin's current 36% drawdown from all-time high is regular](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/bitcoin-down-nearly-30percent-from-record-high-history-shows-thats-normal.html) in its history, and previous cycles saw similar drawdowns followed by rallies to new record highs.

## Geopolitical Developments

### Ukraine Conflict

The [Ukraine war remains a pivotal conflict](https://www.cfr.org/report/conflicts-watch-2025) shaping 2025's geopolitical dynamics:

**Current Status**: [Russian forces have the upper hand](https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/10-conflicts-watch-2025), though their slow advance comes at immense cost - the Kremlin's army has suffered an estimated half-million deaths and injuries since 2022.

**2025 Outlook**: The base case remains ongoing conflict for much of 2025, with heightened risks to civilians and civilian infrastructure. There is increasing pressure for ceasefire negotiations, with Trump administration efforts to broker a deal.

**Broken Promise**: Despite Trump's promise to end the conflict upon his return to the White House, the war continues.

### Middle East Tensions

The Middle East presents [the leading concern among geopolitical survey respondents](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/market-insights/geopolitical-risk):

**Syria**: The [fall of the Assad regime](https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/10-conflicts-watch-2025) is a momentous development for regional security dynamics, challenging Iranian and Russian influence.

**Iran Risk**: Any Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities could provoke a direct confrontation with Tehran.

**Maritime/Missile Threats**: Increased [Houthi maritime and missile strikes](https://egyptoil-gas.com/features/global-energy-markets-on-edge-how-middle-east-and-ukraine-conflicts-shape-2025/) and Hezbollah's retaliatory actions could destabilize critical trade routes and exacerbate global tensions.

### Global Risk Assessment

**Unprecedented Anxiety**: There have [never been so many contingencies rated as high likelihood/high impact](https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2025/in-full/global-risks-2025-a-world-of-growing-divisions-c943fe3ba0/) events since surveys began in 2008.

**Energy Market Impact**: 2025 is poised to be [a year of heightened geopolitical tension](https://egyptoil-gas.com/features/global-energy-markets-on-edge-how-middle-east-and-ukraine-conflicts-shape-2025/) with significant implications for global energy markets.

## Investment Strategy Considerations

### Central Bank Policy Divergence

The most significant theme for 2025 is **central bank policy divergence**:

1. **BOJ Tightening**: Likely rate hike to 0.75% (highest since 1995) on December 19
2. **PBOC Easing**: Historic "moderately loose" policy with continued rate cuts
3. **ECB Pausing**: Data-dependent approach after 100bp of cuts, next projections December 18
4. **Fed Uncertainty**: December 9-10 decision highly uncertain (22%-85% cut probability range)

### Key Catalysts Ahead

**December 9-10**: Federal Reserve FOMC meeting
**December 18**: ECB staff projections release
**December 18-19**: BOJ policy meeting (likely rate hike)

### Risk Factors

1. **Geopolitical Uncertainty**: Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East
2. **Trade Policy Volatility**: Global trade policy uncertainty remains elevated
3. **China Growth Concerns**: Deflationary pressures and weak loan growth
4. **Policy Miscommunication**: Fed officials showing "strongly differing views"

### Opportunities

1. **European Equities**: STOXX 600 targeting 640 by end-2026 (10.5% upside)
2. **Crypto Recovery**: Bitcoin's historical pattern suggests recovery potential after 36% drawdown
3. **Sector Rotation**: Industrial and technology stocks leading European gains

## Conclusion

As we close out the week of December 5, 2025, global markets demonstrate resilience despite significant policy and geopolitical uncertainties. The coming weeks will be critical, with three major central banks making consequential decisions that will shape the trajectory for early 2026. Investors should remain vigilant, focusing on central bank communications, geopolitical developments, and the diverging economic trajectories across major economies.

The BOJ's likely shift to tightening, the PBOC's continued easing, the ECB's cautious pause, and the Fed's uncertain path create a complex environment requiring careful portfolio positioning and active risk management.
