## European Markets

### Market Performance

The [pan-European STOXX 600 finished almost 1.1% higher](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/26/european-markets-on-novpoint26-2025-stoxx-600-ftse-fed-autumn-budget.html) on November 26, 2025, with most sectors and major regional bourses closing in positive territory. This followed a 0.9% gain on November 25, marking a continued rebound in European equities.

### Key Drivers

- **Fed Rate Cut Expectations**: The primary catalyst for European market gains was rising expectations for U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with [markets pricing in almost an 85% chance of a quarter percentage point cut](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/26/european-markets-on-novpoint26-2025-stoxx-600-ftse-fed-autumn-budget.html) at the December 9-10 FOMC meeting
- **Cross-regional Momentum**: European indexes followed their counterparts on Wall Street and in the Asia-Pacific region higher amid synchronized global risk-on sentiment

### ECB Policy Context

**Current Stance:**
- The European Central Bank did not make a policy decision on November 26, 2025
- The ECB released its [Financial Stability Review on November 26, 2025](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251126~408eabd85f.en.pdf), which referenced the STOXX 600 in its analysis of market valuations and financial stability risks
- ECB rates remain at current levels as the central bank maintains a cautious approach to monetary policy

**Key Considerations:**
- The ECB continues to monitor inflation dynamics and financial stability risks across the eurozone
- Market expectations for ECB policy remain anchored to incoming economic data and inflation trends
- The divergence between Fed easing expectations and ECB's cautious stance is creating cross-Atlantic policy differentiation
