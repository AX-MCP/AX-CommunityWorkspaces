### Market Performance

The pan-European **Stoxx 600** demonstrated resilience on November 19, recovering from earlier losses to trade **0.2% higher** by mid-day London time (11:21 a.m.), closing at **561.71**.

The European Central Bank maintained its accommodative stance with no policy changes announced on November 19. The most recent ECB decision came on October 30, 2025:

**Current Interest Rates:**
- **Deposit Facility Rate**: 2.00% (held for third consecutive meeting)
- **Main Refinancing Operations**: 2.15%
