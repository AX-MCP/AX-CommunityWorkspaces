## Conclusion

November 16, 2025 highlighted the diverging trajectories of global markets, with Asia facing economic headwinds while Europe maintains relative stability. The ECB's patient approach contrasts with the BOJ's gradual normalization and PBOC's easing bias, creating currency and capital flow implications.

Geopolitical fragmentation continues to reshape the investment landscape, with infrastructure security, supply chain regionalization, and great power competition driving sector rotations. Investors should maintain diversified exposure with emphasis on quality, defensive characteristics, and sectors benefiting from structural shifts in the global economy.

The upcoming December policy meetings from the ECB and BOJ, along with the G20 Summit, will provide crucial guidance for 2026 market direction.
