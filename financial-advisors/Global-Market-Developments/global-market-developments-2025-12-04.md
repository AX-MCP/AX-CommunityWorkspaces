## Executive Summary

Global markets displayed mixed sentiment on December 4, 2025, as investors positioned themselves ahead of the Federal Reserve's critical December 9-10 policy meeting. Asian markets led gains with Japan's Nikkei surging 2.33%, while European markets ended near the flatline amid defense sector weakness. US markets closed slightly higher with the S&P 500 gaining 0.1% as lighter-than-expected inflation data reinforced rate cut expectations now at 89% probability.

Central bank policy divergence remains the dominant theme, with the Fed poised to ease, the BOJ preparing to tighten, the ECB maintaining rates at 2.0%, and the PBOC continuing its historic "moderately loose" monetary stance.

## 1. European Markets & ECB Policy

### Market Performance

- **STOXX 600**: Ended just above flatline on December 2 (latest available data), with mixed sector performance
- **Utilities**: Best performing sector, adding 0.3%
- **Banking**: FTSE 350 Banks index gained 1.2% after Bank of England trimmed capital buffer requirements

### ECB Policy Stance

The European Central Bank maintains its benchmark rate at **2.0%** as of early December 2025:

**Current Policy Framework:**
- Main refinancing rate: 2.0% (near neutral territory)
- Inflation projection: 2.3% for 2025
- Policy approach: Data-dependent with gradual easing bias
- Next major update: December projections will include first 2028 forecasts

**Historical Context:**
The ECB cut rates by 25 basis points in late January 2025, bringing the main rate from 2.75% to 2.0%. President Christine Lagarde's warnings about eurozone weakness have reinforced market expectations for potential further cuts if economic conditions deteriorate.

**Economic Backdrop:**
- Manufacturing and services activity remains broadly subdued
- Consumer confidence below long-term average
- Inflation gradually converging toward 2% target

## Conclusion

December 4, 2025 markets demonstrated the complex interplay of monetary policy expectations, geopolitical developments, and economic data releases. Asian markets led with strong gains, European markets consolidated, and US markets advanced modestly as investors positioned for the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated December 9-10 policy meeting.

The dominant narrative remains central bank policy divergence, with the Fed poised to ease (89% probability), the ECB holding steady at 2.0%, the BOJ preparing to tighten, and the PBOC maintaining historic accommodation. This divergence creates both opportunities and risks across asset classes and geographies.

Geopolitical factors, particularly Ukraine peace negotiation progress and US-China relations, continue to influence sector performance and risk sentiment. Defense stocks declined on peace hopes, while improved US-China dynamics supported yuan strength and Chinese equities.

Looking ahead, the next two weeks will be critical with the Fed decision (December 9-10) and BOJ meeting (December 18-19) likely setting the tone for year-end positioning and early 2026 market dynamics. Investors should maintain disciplined risk management while positioning for a lower-rate environment with selective exposures to quality growth assets, particularly in technology and well-capitalized financial institutions.
