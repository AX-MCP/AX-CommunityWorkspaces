# Global Market Developments - November 21, 2025

## Executive Summary

Global markets experienced significant volatility on November 21, 2025, driven by AI valuation concerns, geopolitical developments surrounding Ukraine peace negotiations, and shifting expectations for Federal Reserve monetary policy. European markets declined modestly while Asian markets, particularly Japan, experienced sharp selloffs in technology stocks. The session was marked by defense sector weakness on peace deal speculation and reduced December Fed rate cut expectations that were later partially revived.

## European Markets

### Market Performance

The [pan-European Stoxx 600 ended the session 0.4% lower](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/european-markets-nov-21-stoxx-600-ftse-dax-cac.html), with major bourses and most sectors in negative territory. The regional Stoxx Europe Technology index closed 2.3% lower, trading at its lowest level since September 16.

### Sector Movements

**Defense Stocks Under Pressure:**
European [defense stocks sold off significantly on Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/european-markets-nov-21-stoxx-600-ftse-dax-cac.html), with the Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index closing 2.1% lower—its worst day in a month:
- Renk: -8.4%
- Rheinmetall: -7.2%
- Hensoldt: -6.6%

The defense sector decline was directly linked to headlines around a possible peace deal for Ukraine, with reports suggesting Washington and Moscow have been secretly brokering a peace plan to bring the war to an end.

### ECB Monetary Policy Stance

The European Central Bank maintained its [current policy stance with the deposit facility rate at 2%](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2025/html/ecb.mp251030~cf0540b5c0.en.html) following its October 30 meeting (third consecutive hold). Key policy points:

**Interest Rates (as of October 30, 2025):**
- Deposit facility rate: 2.00%
- Main refinancing operations rate: 2.15%
- Marginal lending facility rate: 2.40%

**Inflation Metrics:**
- Headline inflation: 2.2% year-on-year (September), up from 2.0% in August
- Core inflation: 2.4% in September, up from 2.3% in August
- Inflation remains close to the ECB's 2% medium-term target

**Economic Growth:**
- Eurozone GDP rose 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 2025
- Year-on-year growth: 1.3%
- The [economy has continued to grow despite challenging global environment](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/10/30/ecb-keeps-interest-rate-at-2-as-growth-holds-up-against-trade-tension)

**Policy Approach:**
The ECB continues to follow a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach to determining monetary policy stance. The steady holding pattern suggests the ECB believes inflation is largely under control while supporting economic growth.

### Market Drivers

**AI Valuation Concerns:**
Global stocks have [fluctuated wildly this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/european-markets-nov-21-stoxx-600-ftse-dax-cac.html) as concerns about AI valuations hang over equity markets, contributing to technology sector weakness across European bourses.

## Asian Markets

### Market Performance

Asian markets [tracked Wall Street's reversal in AI-related stocks](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/asia-markets-today-friday-nikkei-225-hang-seng-index-kospi-japan-inflation.html), with technology sectors leading declines:

**Japan:**
- Nikkei 225: -2.4% to close at 48,625.88
- Topix: ended flat
- Tech conglomerate SoftBank: -10%+
- Advantest: -12.1%

### Bank of Japan (BOJ) Policy Considerations

[Japan's core inflation in October rose at its sharpest rate since July](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/asia-markets-today-friday-nikkei-225-hang-seng-index-kospi-japan-inflation.html), in line with market estimates, supporting the case for potential interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan. The inflation data strengthens the BOJ's position for normalizing monetary policy, though no immediate action was announced on November 21.

### People's Bank of China (PBOC) Policy

While no specific PBOC policy action occurred on November 21, 2025, the central bank maintained its loan prime rates unchanged in the preceding week, continuing its supportive monetary stance amid concerns about China's economic slowdown affecting regional markets, particularly the Australian dollar which weakened to around 0.63.

### Market Drivers

Asian-Pacific markets fell as:
- U.S. tech stocks lost ground
- Investors' hopes of a December Federal Reserve rate cut initially faded
- [Stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data renewed doubts](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/11/21/asia-markets-today-friday-nikkei-225-hang-seng-index-kospi-japan-inflation.html) about central bank rate cuts
- Traders priced roughly a 40% chance of a quarter-point cut in December (before Williams' comments)

## Geopolitical Developments

### Ukraine Peace Negotiations - Critical Development

November 21, 2025, marked a significant turning point in the Russia-Ukraine conflict with major implications for global markets:

**U.S. Peace Proposal:**
The [White House is pressuring Ukraine to sign on to its new peace proposal by Thanksgiving](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/21/ukraine-war-peace-proposal-witkoff-thanksgiving/) (November 27) or lose U.S. support in its war with Russia.

**Putin's Response:**
Russian President Vladimir Putin [cautiously welcomed the U.S. proposal](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/g-s1-98791/ukraine-russia-war-us-peace-plan), saying it "could form the basis of a final peace settlement."

**Key Provisions of the 28-Point Plan:**
- Russia would be granted de facto control of Ukraine's Donbas region
- The area from which Kyiv withdraws would be considered a demilitarized zone
- [While Ukraine would not be required to recognize Moscow's claimed territory](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/11/19/us-russia-secret-peace-deal-ukraine-donbas-security-guarantees-zelensky/), the United States and other countries would accept that Crimea and the Donbas are lawfully part of Russia

**Ukrainian Response:**
President Zelensky confirmed that [Ukraine might soon face a difficult choice](https://kyivindependent.com/a-plan-of-capitulation-us-push-for-controversial-peace-plan-met-with-backlash-in-ukraine/)—"either the loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner." Some Ukrainian lawmakers characterized the plan as "a plan of capitulation and betrayal."

**Market Impact:**
The peace deal speculation directly drove the 2.1% decline in European defense stocks, representing their worst single-day performance in a month as investors priced in reduced defense spending expectations.

### Broader Geopolitical Landscape

**Other Regional Developments Being Monitored:**
- [Arctic geopolitical rivalries accelerating](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/geostrategy/geostrategic-analysis) in tandem with economic opportunities
- Gaza ceasefire stability monitoring
- US-China tensions following APEC and G20 Summit in South Africa

**Sector-Specific Impacts:**
Ongoing conflicts and US-China technology rivalry continue [impacting operations across multiple sectors](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/geostrategy/geostrategic-analysis):
- Energy sector
- Defense industry
- Technology (particularly semiconductors)
- Shipping and logistics

**Strategic Business Responses:**
Companies are localizing supply chains and operations in response to trade tensions and regulatory fragmentation, signaling a long-term strategic shift in global business operations.

## U.S. Federal Reserve Policy Outlook

### Dramatic Shift on November 21

The November 21 session witnessed a [significant reversal in Federal Reserve rate cut expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/us-treasury-yields-edge-lower-as-fed-rate-cut-bets-fall.html) following comments from a key Fed official:

**Williams' Comments:**
Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams stated he [sees room to lower interest rates again in the near term](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-21/fed-s-williams-sees-room-for-an-interest-rate-cut-in-near-term) as the labor market softens, reviving investor expectations for a December rate cut.

**Key Quote:**
"I still see room for a further adjustment in the near term to the target range for the federal funds rate to move the stance of policy closer to the range of neutral," Williams said in a speech in Chile.

**Market Reaction:**
Investors [boosted the odds of a rate cut at the Fed's December 9-10 policy meeting to around 70%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-21/fed-s-williams-sees-room-for-an-interest-rate-cut-in-near-term) after Williams' comments, according to pricing in futures contracts, up from around 35% earlier in the session.

### Context and Challenges

**Earlier Deterioration in Rate Cut Expectations:**
Prior to Williams' comments, the probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut had [fallen to 22%, down from 97% in mid-October](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-december-2025-rate-cut-probability-fomc-meeting-economy/), reflecting solid U.S. job growth data that suggested the Fed might hold off on lowering borrowing costs.

**Committee Division:**
The [Federal Reserve is deeply divided](https://fortune.com/2025/11/20/fed-minutes-divided-committee-rate-cut-december-wish/) between officials who think it should cut interest rates in December and those who don't, adding uncertainty to the policy outlook.

**Global Impact:**
The shifting Fed expectations directly influenced global markets on November 21, contributing to:
- Reduced risk appetite in Asian markets during morning trading
- Pressure on technology stocks globally
- Currency market volatility, with the dollar strengthening before Williams' comments

The euro [strengthened against the dollar, trading above 1.08](https://www.fxleaders.com/news/2025/11/21/market-sentiment-pulse-a-brief-update-on-whats-moving-markets-and-why-november-21-2025/), following positive economic data from the Eurozone and better-than-expected inflation figures.

**Australian Dollar:**

**U.S. Dollar:**
The stronger U.S. labor market reinforced the dollar's position during early trading, though Williams' comments later in the session moderated dollar strength.

**Overall Sentiment:**
[Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, but volatility is expected to persist](https://www.fxleaders.com/news/2025/11/21/market-sentiment-pulse-a-brief-update-on-whats-moving-markets-and-why-november-21-2025/) as traders digest economic data and geopolitical developments.

## Key Risk Factors for International Markets

### Immediate Risks (Next 7-30 Days)

1. **Ukraine Peace Deal Deadline:** November 27 (Thanksgiving) deadline for Ukraine's response to U.S. peace proposal could trigger significant market volatility depending on outcome

2. **Federal Reserve Meeting:** December 9-10 FOMC meeting with 70% market-implied probability of rate cut following Williams' comments

3. **AI Valuation Concerns:** Continued scrutiny of AI stock valuations affecting global technology sectors

4. **China Economic Slowdown:** Ongoing concerns about Chinese growth impacting regional markets and commodity currencies

### Medium-Term Risks

1. **ECB Policy Path:** Data-dependent approach creates uncertainty around timing of future policy adjustments

2. **BOJ Normalization:** Rising Japanese inflation supporting case for rate hikes, potentially strengthening yen and impacting carry trades

3. **Geopolitical Fragmentation:** US-China technology rivalry and supply chain localization affecting long-term corporate strategies

4. **Defense Spending Uncertainty:** Peace deal developments could significantly impact European defense sector revenues and investment plans

---

## Upcoming Key Dates

### Central Bank Meetings
- **Federal Reserve:** December 9-10, 2025 (FOMC Meeting)
- **ECB:** Next policy decision expected in December 2025 (specific date TBD)
- **BOJ:** Ongoing monitoring of inflation data for potential policy normalization timing

### Geopolitical Events
- **November 27, 2025:** Thanksgiving deadline for Ukraine's response to U.S. peace proposal
- **Ongoing:** US-China trade and technology tensions monitoring
- **Ongoing:** Middle East conflict developments

---

## Market Outlook and Implications

### Short-Term Outlook

Markets face elevated volatility in the near term as multiple uncertainties converge:
- Resolution (or escalation) of Ukraine peace negotiations by November 27
- Federal Reserve policy decision on December 9-10
- Continued AI valuation reassessment across global technology sectors

### Sector-Specific Implications

**Technology:**
Heightened scrutiny of AI valuations likely to persist, creating volatility in semiconductor and tech conglomerate stocks across Japan, Europe, and the U.S.

**Defense:**
Peace deal developments represent the most significant risk factor, with potential for sharp moves based on negotiation outcomes. The -2.1% single-day decline on November 21 may be just the beginning if peace prospects solidify.

**Financials:**
Banking sectors should monitor diverging central bank policies—potential Fed cuts vs. potential BOJ hikes—creating trading opportunities but also currency-related headwinds.

**Energy:**
Geopolitical developments, particularly Ukraine peace negotiations and Middle East stability, remain key drivers alongside China demand concerns.

### Strategic Considerations for Investors

1. **Diversification Across Geographies:** Diverging central bank policies and regional geopolitical developments argue for geographic diversification

2. **Currency Hedging:** Elevated FX volatility expected as monetary policies diverge (Fed potentially cutting, BOJ potentially hiking)

3. **Defensive Positioning:** Consider reducing exposure to sectors most sensitive to geopolitical developments (defense) and valuation concerns (AI/technology)

4. **Opportunistic Stance:** Market volatility may create entry points in fundamentally sound companies affected by temporary sentiment shifts

## Conclusion

November 21, 2025, encapsulated the complex, interconnected nature of modern global markets. The session demonstrated how geopolitical developments (Ukraine peace negotiations), monetary policy signals (Williams' rate cut comments), and sectoral concerns (AI valuations) can simultaneously drive market movements across continents and asset classes.

The most significant development was the emergence of a concrete Ukraine peace proposal with a hard deadline, shifting defense sector dynamics and potentially reshaping European security architecture. Combined with the Fed's renewed openness to December rate cuts and ongoing AI valuation concerns, investors face a challenging but potentially rewarding environment requiring vigilance, flexibility, and disciplined risk management.

The coming weeks will be critical as the November 27 Ukraine deadline approaches and the December 9-10 Fed meeting looms, likely determining market direction into year-end and setting the stage for 2026.
