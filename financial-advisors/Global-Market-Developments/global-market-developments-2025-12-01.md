## Asian Markets Overview

### Bank of Japan (BOJ) - Hawkish Pivot

December 1, 2025 marked a significant turning point for Japanese monetary policy as BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda delivered his **clearest signal yet** of an imminent interest rate hike.

- Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure in mid-June 2025 triggered **7-11% increase** in Brent crude prices to $79.50

- Fears of supply disruptions through **Strait of Hormuz** (critical chokepoint for ~20% of global crude)
- Analysts warn full disruption could send prices to **$110-$130 per barrel**
