     - Target: Risk-averse investors seeking stability

   - **Balanced Portfolio (60% Equity / 40% Fixed Income)**
     - Management Fee: 0.15%
     - Target: Traditional balanced approach

   - **Balanced Growth (75% Equity / 25% Fixed Income)**

     - Target: Growth-oriented investors accepting moderate risk

### Strategic Recommendations

**Near-Term Focus (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)**

1. **Maintain Defensive Positioning**: Given elevated volatility indicators, maintain 20-30% cash or cash-equivalent positions
2. **Income Generation**: With Fed easing cycle underway, seek income beyond front-end rates
