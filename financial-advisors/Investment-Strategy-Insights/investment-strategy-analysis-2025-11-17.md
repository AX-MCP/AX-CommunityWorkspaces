## Asset Allocation Strategy

### Current Market Environment Assessment

The investment landscape in November 2025 requires a recalibration of traditional allocation strategies. The fundamental shift in stock-bond correlations, driven by persistent inflation and fiscal imbalances, has undermined traditional diversification benefits.

### Strategic Rationale

**Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets:** Given the breakdown of traditional stock-bond correlations, portfolios benefit from exposure to international equities, precious metals, and alternative strategies. The exceptional performance of gold miners (up 69-79% in 2025) validates this approach.

**Inflation Hedging:** Maintaining underweight cash positions while favoring short-duration TIPS addresses elevated inflation expectations while preserving flexibility.

**International Exposure:** U.S. investors face increased dollar risk premium, making international diversification more critical.

## Top-Performing ETFs Analysis

### Precious Metals Miners (Exceptional Performance)

Gold prices have surged from approximately $2,600 at the start of 2025 to over $4,200, driving extraordinary returns in precious metals mining ETFs:

| ETF | Ticker | 2025 Return | Focus |
|-----|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Sprott Gold Miners ETF** | SGDM | +79% | Gold miners |
| **iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF** | RING | +77% | Global gold miners |
| **iShares MSCI Global Silver & Metals Miners** | SLVP | +77% | Silver & metals miners |
| **Select Stoxx Europe Aerospace & Defense** | EUAD | +73% | European defense |
| **Global X Silver Miners ETF** | SIL | +72% | Silver miners |
| **VanEck Gold Miners ETF** | GDX | +71% | Gold mining companies |
| **VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF** | GDXJ | +69% | Junior gold miners |

**Investment Thesis:** Precious metals miners have become the dominant theme in 2025, surpassing even AI/technology in performance. This reflects investor demand for inflation hedges, geopolitical risk mitigation, and safe-haven assets in a "higher-for-longer" rate environment.

### Technology & AI ETFs (Solid but Slowing)

| ETF | Ticker | 2025 Return | Focus |
|-----|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Roundhill Generative AI & Technology** | CHAT | +49.5% | Generative AI |
| **VanEck Semiconductor ETF** | SMH | +42.5% | Semiconductors |
| **WisdomTree AI & Innovation Fund** | WTAI | +34% | AI innovation |

**Investment Thesis:** While AI/technology ETFs continue delivering strong returns, recent market weakness suggests growing valuation concerns. The absence of AI from the list of most profitable tactical funds indicates potential sector rotation.

### Sector Performance ETFs

Recent sector trends show rotation away from mega-cap technology:

**Best Performing Sectors (Last Week):**
1. **Healthcare** (+4%+) - Benefiting from AI integration and efficiency solutions
2. **Energy** (Top 3) - Resilient defensive play with 9.9% Q1 return
3. **Materials** (Top 3) - Commodity exposure supporting performance

- **Financials** (+38.01% through November 2024) - Benefiting from resilient economy and rate environment

## Conclusion

November 17, 2025 presents investors with a transitional market environment characterized by healthy correction dynamics after strong YTD gains, shifting sector leadership away from mega-cap technology, and Federal Reserve policy uncertainty. The exceptional performance of precious metals miners reflects investor demand for inflation hedges and safe-haven assets, while recent technology weakness suggests valuation concerns are tempering AI enthusiasm.

The key to navigating this environment is maintaining disciplined diversification beyond traditional stock-bond allocations, focusing on quality companies with sustainable business models, and implementing robust risk management practices. The breakdown of traditional asset correlations makes alternative investments, international exposure, and precious metals allocation more critical than ever.

While near-term volatility is likely to persist as markets digest upcoming economic data and Fed signals, the long-term outlook remains constructive given strong corporate earnings, ongoing technological innovation, and resilient economic fundamentals. Investors should view pullbacks as opportunities to rebalance toward strategic targets and accumulate quality names at more attractive valuations.

**Key Takeaway:** In this environment of elevated inflation, uncertain Fed policy, and sector rotation, portfolio success depends on diversification discipline, risk management rigor, and maintaining a long-term perspective through short-term market noise.
