## Asset Allocation Strategy

### Current Market Environment Assessment

The traditional relationship between stocks and bonds has fundamentally shifted in 2025, requiring investors to rethink classic portfolio construction:

**Key Changes:**
- **Correlation Breakdown**: Stocks and bonds moving in tandem, reducing traditional diversification benefits
- **Valuation Concerns**: Growth equity valuations increasingly stretched
- **Policy Uncertainty**: Higher-for-longer rate environment caps upside potential
- **Diversification Imperative**: Need for non-traditional assets to achieve true portfolio diversification

### Recommended Asset Allocation by Risk Profile

#### Conservative Portfolio (65% Fixed Income / 25% Equities / 10% Alternatives)

**Fixed Income (65%):**
- **40%** High-quality bonds (short to intermediate duration)
- **15%** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
- **10%** 3-7 year Treasury curve (belly positioning)

**Equities (25%):**
- **15%** Large-cap value and dividend-focused stocks
- **5%** International developed markets (Japan focus)
- **5%** Emerging markets for diversification

**Alternatives (10%):**
- **5%** Gold and precious metals ETFs
- **5%** Real estate and infrastructure

**Rationale:** Emphasizes capital preservation while maintaining inflation protection through TIPS. Short-duration focus provides flexibility as Fed policy evolves.

#### Moderate Portfolio (50% Equities / 40% Fixed Income / 10% Alternatives)

**Equities (50%):**
- **25%** U.S. large-cap growth (selective, quality focus)
- **10%** U.S. large-cap value
- **8%** International equities (Japan, Hong Kong, select EM)
- **7%** Sector-specific ETFs (Industrials, Utilities, Communication Services)

**Fixed Income (40%):**
- **20%** Investment-grade corporate bonds
- **10%** U.S. Treasuries (3-7 year duration)
- **10%** TIPS and inflation-linked bonds

**Alternatives (10%):**
- **4%** Gold/Silver ETFs
- **3%** Liquid alternatives
- **3%** Digital assets (Bitcoin/Blockchain ETFs)

**Rationale:** Balanced approach leveraging growth opportunities while maintaining defensive positioning. International diversification reduces correlation to U.S.-specific risks.

#### Aggressive Portfolio (75% Equities / 15% Fixed Income / 10% Alternatives)

**Equities (75%):**
- **35%** U.S. large-cap growth (Technology, Communication Services)
- **15%** Small and mid-cap growth
- **10%** International equities (focused on emerging markets)
- **8%** Sector rotation strategies (Industrials, Technology, Defense)
- **7%** Thematic ETFs (AI, Blockchain, Aerospace)

**Fixed Income (15%):**
- **10%** Short-duration investment-grade bonds
- **5%** TIPS for inflation hedge

**Alternatives (10%):**
- **5%** Precious metals (Gold/Silver miners)
- **3%** Blockchain and crypto-exposure ETFs
- **2%** Commodities

**Rationale:** Maximizes growth potential while maintaining tactical flexibility. Diversified sector exposure captures multiple growth themes. Precious metals and crypto provide uncorrelated return sources.

### Special Consideration: The Evolved 60/40 Portfolio

The classic 60/40 stock/bond portfolio remains viable but requires modifications:

**Traditional Challenges:**
- Bonds provided limited diversification in 2022 drawdown
- Correlation between stocks and bonds has increased
- Lower forward returns expected from both asset classes

**2025 Adaptations:**
- **Expand bond toolkit**: Include TIPS, floating-rate notes, international bonds
- **Quality over yield**: Focus on high-quality fixed income rather than reaching for yield in tight-spread environments
- **Add alternative diversifiers**: Allocate 5-10% to gold, commodities, or liquid alternatives
- **Selective equity positioning**: Favor sectors with strong fundamentals and reasonable valuations

## Conclusion

November 15, 2025, encapsulates the challenging investment environment facing portfolio managers: elevated valuations, uncertain Fed policy, rotating sector leadership, and evolving correlations between asset classes. The successful bounce from intraday lows demonstrates market resilience, but the underlying volatility suggests caution is warranted.

The path forward requires balancing multiple objectives:
- Capturing growth opportunities in AI, defense, and infrastructure themes
- Protecting against downside risk through diversification and hedging
- Generating income in a higher-rate environment
- Adapting to structural changes in traditional stock-bond relationships

Precious metals' dominance in 2025 performance rankings reflects investor demand for safe-haven assets amid uncertainty. Technology's recent struggles, despite strong long-term fundamentals, highlight the importance of valuation discipline. Fixed income is reclaiming its role as a legitimate portfolio component, but traditional diversification benefits require supplementation with alternative assets.

Investors should maintain a balanced, diversified approach with regular rebalancing, avoid overconcentration in any single sector or theme, and keep sufficient dry powder to capitalize on market dislocations. The current environment rewards patience, discipline, and tactical flexibility over aggressive directional bets.
