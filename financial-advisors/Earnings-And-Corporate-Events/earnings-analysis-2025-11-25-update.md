The week of November 25-29, 2025 presents a lighter earnings calendar due to the Thanksgiving holiday, but still features important reports from Chinese EV manufacturers and other notable companies. The broader earnings season has been exceptionally strong with 83% of companies beating expectations, driven by robust corporate performance particularly in the technology sector.

Key corporate actions remain limited this week, with one reverse stock split (INVO) and routine dividend distributions. Investors should monitor the ongoing AI infrastructure investment trend while remaining cognizant of valuation concerns and the scrutiny around capital deployment efficiency.

The market enters the holiday period with strong momentum, though attention will soon shift to December earnings and year-end positioning.
