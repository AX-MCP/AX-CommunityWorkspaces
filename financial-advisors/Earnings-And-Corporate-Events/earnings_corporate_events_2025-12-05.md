The week of December 5-11 marks the conclusion of a strong Q3 2025 earnings season with 83% of companies beating estimates and 13.4% earnings growth. The AI infrastructure buildout continues to drive technology sector strength, with Marvell's $3.25B Celestial AI acquisition and Broadcom's upcoming results highlighting sustained demand.

Retail earnings this week will provide crucial insights into consumer spending health as we head into the holiday season, with particular focus on Dollar General and Ulta Beauty results. The M&A market remains robust across sectors, supported by stabilizing interest rates and improved capital market conditions.

Key risks include market selectivity (heavy punishment for misses), growth deceleration concerns (Snowflake), and elevated valuations (21.5x forward P/E). However, record profit margins, strong guidance, and sustained AI investment suggest corporate fundamentals remain solid heading into year-end.

**Broadcom's December 11 report will be the most closely watched event**, offering critical visibility into the sustainability of AI infrastructure spending and the health of the semiconductor industry's record backlogs.
